The pointed snout extends beyond the lower jaw. The fish resembles a sprat in having a forked tail and a single dorsal fin, but the body is round and slender, and it has a silver underbelly and blue, green or grey back and sides. It has a silver stripe along flank, disappearing with age.", "about": "In the east Atlantic, this species is present from Bergen, Norway to East London, South Africa perhaps reaching Durban. This coastal, pelagic species is found mainly in shallow water (to 50 m) and to depths of about 400 m, often forming large shoals and is migratory. It is euryhaline, tolerating salinities of five to 41% and in some areas entering lagoons, estuaries or lakes, especially in the warmer months. Pelagic fish occupy a key position in the marine food web where they are the link that transfers energy produced by plankton to large-bodied predator fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Estimates of forage fish losses to predation are typically much higher than losses to fisheries. Anchovies are mostly reduced to fish meal and oil in industrial-scale factories and used as a protein supplement in agri- or aqua-feeds. The abrupt eastward shift in adult anchovy biomass is being monitored.", "biology": "Spawning occurs multiple times over an extended period with peaks usually in the warmest months. Eggs float in the upper 50 m, hatching in 24 to 65 hours. After hatching, larvae are colourless and transparent. Growth is rapid with fish reaching a length of 9-10 cm after one year. First spawning occurs at sizes greater than 12-13 cm. Maximum age of individuals from southwestern Africa was three years.", "citation": "The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, FishBase, Status of the South African Marine Fishery Resources, DFFE 2023."}',

It is found from shallow waters to 1,000 m depth. It is found in small schools on the continental slope. Anglefish embark on vertical migrations daily and exercises diel migration where it migrates to shallower depth at night. Seasonal migrations have been linked to water temperature. Its diet consists of myctophids (the most abundant and diverse mesopelagic (200 to 1000 m down) fishes in the Southern Ocean), other small bony fishes and invertebrates. It is an important prey item for large pelagic predators such as dolphin, sharks, and tunas. They feed on small fishes and macroinvertebrates including squid. They are year-round batch spawners that undergo significant morphological changes with growth. In South Africa, it is a common bycatch of the hake fishery where it is generally known and sold as \"angelfish\", although it is not a true marine angelfish.", "biology": "Brama brama is oviparous with planktonic eggs and larvae and spawns in the summer months.

This species is caught and retained as bycatch in several fisheries including industrial crustacean trawl and small-scale gillnet fisheries throughout most of its range. While the population trajectory is stable at the southern end of its range in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, it is suspected to be declining throughout the rest of its range as a result of largely unregulated trawl and gillnet fisheries. Individuals caught in the prawn trawl fishery over the Thukela Banks have been identified as juveniles and therefore there may be a nursery area nearby. The occasional catch (25 per annum) of this species in the KZN shark nets comprised mainly mature individuals of both sexes with a significant proportion released alive.", "biology": "The species is lecithotrophic (no nutrition other than the yolk originally contained within its egg) viviparous and gives birth to live young that are 28-30 cm total length with a gestation length of approximately one year and litter sizes of around six (range 1-12).

As a juvenile it displays large white patches on its dorsal surface that darken with age.", "about": "Baardman are distributed in the western Indian Ocean from, Cape Point in SA to Oman. Baardman is a shallow-water resident species, occurring from the surf zone to 40 m water depth from False Bay along the entire eastern seaboard of SA. ORI and De Hoop tagging data show very limited coastwise movement, diver counts and depletion sampling indicates that Baardman are probably philopatric (tending to return to or remain near a particular site or area) at \"home\" caves. Adults inhabit sandy substrata, mixed rock and sand surf-zones and subtidal reefs; most commonly associated with high relief limestone or sandstone reef structures. Juveniles are found in mixed rock and sand surf-zones around shallow subtidal reefs. Adults feed on rocky reef and soft sediment invertebrates, including polychaetes (bristle worms), crustaceans and mollusks that are buried in the sand. Juveniles eat predominantly polychaetes (bristle worms) and small crustaceans. Baardman are an important target species in the spearfishery throughout its range where it ranks in the top 10 species. They are relatively easy to spear as they often aggregate in caves. They are targeted species in the shore angling fishery in the WC and EC, particularly on sand banks or in mixed rock and sand habitat. They are also occasionally taken as bycatches in beach treknetters along the northern shore of False Bay.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Gonochorist (separate sexes).

They have large scales and a pointed head with a large mouth and long knife-like teeth. Great Barracuda have a large gape. It has a lower jaw projecting which is helpful in biting. They are a grayish brown above and silvery below which is quite universal throughout their geographic range. They often have dark ink-like spots that are arranged in no pattern on their sides. The young have dark crossbars on their backs and blotches on their sides. The young also have a soft dorsal fin and the anal and caudal fins can be blackish. Males and females are indistinguishable to humans.", "about": "Great Barracuda are distributed in tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific: Red Sea and east coast of Africa across to Hawaii and the Marquesan and Tuamoto islands, also in western and eastern Atlantic, but not in eastern Pacific. In southern Africa they occur mainly from KZN northwards, but occasional specimens may be found as far south as Port Alfred. Their movement patterns are unknown. There is evidence of nomadism in the Bahamas, but 21 recaptures reported in SA waters indicate residency in young fish, especially within the Kosi Bay estuarine lake system (ORI Tagging Project). Adults are found mainly over coral reefs and seagrass beds, down to at least 100 m. Juveniles inhabit tropical mangrove areas and estuaries. In the Kosi estuarine lake system, fry enter from the sea at a length of 20 mm and live in reed beds until reaching a length of 300 mm, when they move into open water within the estuary, all within a salinity range of 4-35%. Great Barracuda are classified as a marine species with juveniles occurring mainly in estuaries, but they are also found at sea. Adults are piscivorous feeding on species such as needlefish, halfbeaks, puffers, kingfish and mullet. Juveniles are also piscivorous feeding on small mullet, clupeids (the herrings, shads, sardines, etc), pursemouths (silverbiddies), gobies and sparids (sea breams and porgies). Juveniles are caught frequently in the fish traps and illegal gillnets in the Kosi estuarine lake system. Larger individuals are caught on live bait and lures from ski-boats, and sometimes by spearfishers. They are also occasionally taken by shore anglers. In KZN, Great Barracuda are mainly caught in the north of the province. The Kosi estuarine lake system is an important nursery area for this species.

Its absence in the Persian Gulf is puzzling. The southernmost limit in SA waters is Algoa Bay. Limited data from the ORI Tagging Project suggests that this species is likely to be fairly resident. Adult large fish can be found in estuaries and shelf waters to 100 m and also found on coral and rocky reefs, often associated with caves. Also occasionally caught in shallow (<50 m) prawn trawls on the Thukela Banks so must move onto sand-mud substrata at times. A favourite food on coral reefs and in rocky areas is spiny lobsters. A 177 cm standard length fish, caught from shore at Maui, Hawaiian Islands, contained 2 spiny lobsters and several large crabs. It is also known to eat a variety of fishes, including small sharks and batoids and juvenile sea turtles; in South African estuaries, the main prey item is the mud crab (Scylla serrata). Small juveniles are found in estuaries and sometimes in tidal rock pools. Adults feed on   lobsters, crabs, fish (including elasmobranchs). The juvenile\u2019s diet is unknown. Once a prime target for spearfishers due to its large size, trophy status and the fact that this species is inquisitive and easy to approach underwater, this species was over-exploited and has been fully protected in SA waters since 1992. Prior to its protection this species was also occasionally caught by recreational and commercial skiboat fishers, shore anglers and occasionally taken as a bycatch by shallow prawn trawlers. It is becoming increasingly popular in the live food and aquarium trade; this species is now being hatchery reared and grown in captivity. They are now a protected species and on the Prohibited Species List in South Africa.", "biology": "Brindle Bass are likely to be protogynous, (born female and changes sex to male) but not confirmed.

They are resident; of the 350 Potato Bass tagged, 19 (5.43%) have been recaptured with an average distance moved of only 2 km and a maximum distance of 14km. Adults are reef-associated species mainly found on deep reefs, seamounts, and other current prone areas in 10-400 m. Juveniles may be found in tidal pools and gullies, larger juveniles are found on shallow subtidal reefs in the surf-zone. The adult\u2019s diet includes a variety of reef fish, crustaceans and rays. Juveniles feed on small fish and crustaceans. Once abundant on inshore reefs in northern KZN, this species was over-exploited particularly by spearfishermen due to its large size, trophy status and the fact that this species is inquisitive and easy to approach underwater. The proclamations of the St Lucia and Maputaland MPAs in 1979 and 1986, respectively, have resulted in a strong recovery of this species. In addition, Potato Bass have been fully protected in SA waters since 1992. As a top keystone predator on coral reefs, Potato Bass is an important indicator species of reef health. They are now a protected species and on the Prohibited Species List in South Africa.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Assumed to be protogynous (born female and changes sex to male), but reproductive mode still uncertain.

There are two disjunct populations, one along the eastern seaboard of SA from Cape Point to southern and the other from NAM to southern Angola.

They always have a large black spot on each side of their caudal peduncle. As juveniles, they have 8-10 pale vertical bars on their sides that fade with age.", "about": "Blacktail are residents. Tagging studies show a meant distance travelled at only 6km. Similarly, juveniles have been shown to display high levels of site fidelity in rocky intertidal nursery areas. Adults inhabit shallow rocky and sandy substrata down to 40 m but predominantly in the surf-zone, usually in close association with rocky areas. Juveniles can be found in intertidal rock pools, subtidal gullies, shallow subtidal reefs, sandy beach surf-zone and estuary mouths. Adults are generalists feeding on a wide range of organisms including red and green algae, echinoids (sea urchins), polychaetes (bristle worms), anthozoans (sea anemone or coral), gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs), bivalves and ascidians (sea squirts). Juveniles will eat small crustaceans such as grammarid (small, shrimp-like crustaceans) and caprellid amphipods (skeleton or ghost shrimps), harpacticoid copepods (small free swimming marine shrimps), polychaetes (bristle worms) and echinoids (sea urchins). Blacktail are caught primarily in the shore fishery along the entire south-eastern seaboard of SA where it ranks as the third most important shore angling species. The mean size of Blacktail in KZN has remained relatively constant at around 225 mm FL. Despite its relatively slow growth rate, Blacktail is still an extremely abundant species along the entire eastern seaboard of SA and appears to have been able to withstand increasing fishing pressure, probably mainly due to its small size/age at maturity, adaptable mode of reproduction, high fecundity and generalist lifestyle. Furthermore, indications are that fisheries management interventions (minimum size and daily bag limits) and establishment of no-take MPAs along the SA coast have helped to sustain Blacktail populations. Fish in warmer KZN waters reach maturity at a smaller size/age and do not reach the same maximum size as those in cooler Cape waters. As this species is extremely important to both recreational and subsistence shore fishers throughout its distribution, monitoring of catch and effort in the SA shore fishery should be improved.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Has been described in KZN as rudimentary hermaphrodite (possessing both male and female potential prior to sexual maturation where no sex change occurs in mature individuals), however evidence also exits that Blacktail is a digynous hermaphrodite with partial protandry (males turning into females) occurring in some of the male population. Breeding/spawning season: May-Dec peaking Jul-Sep in KZN; Aug-Mar peaking Sep-Dec in EC. Breeding/spawning locality: Inshore reefs, probably throughout its distribution.

In SA they extend down the east coast of Africa, occasionally reaching as far south as Knysna and are also abundant on the SE coast of Madagascar. There may be some confusion with the closely related Soldier Bream (A. filamentosus), which also occurs in our area. Their movement patterns are unknown. Some evidence exists of large aggregations during autumn in the Gulf of Aden. Adults are known to occur on a wide range of bottom substrata including soft bottoms and low relief reef in depths from 30-400 m. Juveniles are found in shallow waters of sheltered bays 5-30 m. Adults eat bottom living invertebrates, mostly hard-shelled molluscs, stomatopods (mantis shrimps), shrimps and crabs. The juvenile\u2019s diet is unknown.

The body has a compact bream shape, the front of the snout is slightly concave, and the anal fin is yellowish. Adults have yellow anal fins, and the edge of the operculum is blackish; juveniles have bluish fins. They are generally silver, but adults from brackish water are dark to almost black. The centers of the scales are typically dark. About the Species The River Bream is endemic occurring from central Mozambique and southwards to Swartvlei near Knysna. The distribution is not certain as this fish has been confused with the Picnic Seabream, Acanthopagrus berda. Because of the difficulty in differentiating the two fishes, anglers may not be able to identify which one they have caught. They are resident and an estuarine-dependent species with only a marine egg and larval phase. The River Bream is found mainly in estuaries and in brackish water, occasionally entering the lower stretches of freshwater rivers. Adults undertake an annual spawning migration down to the estuary mouth to spawn. Adults tolerate a wide range of salinities and turbidities and are rarely found far from estuaries in the marine environment. Juveniles less than 1 year old enter KZN estuaries at 10-50 mm SL, between Jul-Dec. Egg and larval development takes place at sea. The adult\u2019s diet is wide and includes amphipods (crustaceans with no carapace), polychaetes (bristle worms), bivalves, crustaceans, gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs), aquatic plants and small fish. The juvenile\u2019s diet from 20-60 mm consists mainly of amphipods (crustaceans with no carapace), planktonic copepods (small aquatic crustaceans), chironomid (midge) larvae, tanaids (bottom-dwelling marine and brackish-water crustaceans) and aquatic plants. In SA estuaries River Bream is harvested by recreational boat and shore anglers and by subsistence fishers using lines, fish traps and gillnets. It is a particularly important component of the recreational and subsistence catch in the three large northern KZN estuaries, Kosi Bay, St Lucia and Richards Bay and the Durban Harbour.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Assumed to be a protandrous hermaphrodite (changes sex from male to female). Breeding/spawning season: In KZN, occurring from Apr-Jul, with peak spawning possibly occurring in May-Jun. Also records exist of peak spawning in Durban Harbour in Jul-Aug, with spawning starting as early as March. Breeding/spawning locality: It occurs in nearshore marine environments, primarily in estuary mouths but seldom in the sea.

The nostrils are very large, and are flanked by greatly expanded, triangular skin flaps that reach the mouth. There are furrows at the corners of the mouth on both jaws. The teeth have a central cusp and a pair of smaller cusplets on the sides. The five pairs of gill slits are positioned on the upper sides of the body.", "about": "The Brown Shyshark is endemic to South Africa to the shallow, coastal waters in the Southeast Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans from False Bay, Western Cape to Durban. This benthic (bottom-dwelling) species is usually found close to the bottom over sandy flats or rocky reefs, from the intertidal zone to a depth of 35 m. However, it has been reported from as deep as 133 m. The range of this species overlaps with the Puffadder Shyshark in the southeastern Cape region. There, the Brown Shyshark tends to favor shallow inshore habitats, while the Puffadder Shyshark inhabits deeper offshore waters. It feeds on lobsters, crabs and small bony fish. Although the Brown Shyshark is discarded, many fishers regard the species as a nuisance and persecute them as such likely causing high post-release mortality. It is suspected that the Brown Shyshark has undergone a population reduction of 30-49% over the past 60 years. Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates.", "biology": "Reproduction is oviparous, with females depositing egg capsules (known as \"mermaid''s purses\") two at a time. Embryos feed solely on yolk. Males reach sexual maturity at a length of 68-69 cm, and females at a length of 60-61 cm.

Early juveniles inhabit coastal areas, near beaches, river mouths, barrier islands, lower reaches of bays and inlets, or bays of relatively high salinities. They are strong, aggressive predators.  Adults feed almost exclusively on planktonic crustaceans such as portunid (swimming) crabs, but benthic invertebrates, squid and fish are also taken. The diet of the juvenile is unknown, presumably mainly planktonic organisms. Throughout SA, Cobia is an incidental catch in the various fisheries. They form a small component of the catch by the recreational boat sector in KZN (Mann et al. 1997a, Dunlop and Mann 2013). Also forms a small percentage of the catch in the KZN spearfishery.

They are seldom caught in KZN waters but have been caught as far north as Richards Bay. They are more common in the EC and WC. Tagging results suggest that Dageraad are fairly resident although there may be some nomadic movement between reefs. Adults are found on offshore reefs between 20-100 m while juveniles occupy shallow subtidal reefs 10-30 m in the SE Cape. Adults are benthic carnivores feeding on a wide variety of reef-associated invertebrates; juveniles eat the same as adults but smaller size of food items. Dageraad are important to commercial and recreational ski-boat linefisheries in the EC and WC but a decline in abundance and strict species-specific regulations have reduced its importance in the commercial linefishery. They are occasionally taken by spearfishers capable of diving on deeper reefs (>20 m). There is strong evidence to suggest that the CPUE for Dageraad has declined substantially throughout their distributional range except within no-take MPAs such as the Tsitsikamma National Park. The increase in the minimum size limit to 40 cm TL and the drop in the commercial and recreational bag limit to 1pppd in April 2005 were partly responsible for the observed decrease in catch composition. This has skewed sex ratios with fewer males in areas with higher fishing effort. Fish are thus recruited into the fishery before maturity.

They carry their pups in utero and typically for 2 years making it the longest gestation period of any vertebrate. Reproduction is perhaps the answer to why females are so much larger than males since larger female sharks are more likely to have a larger litter size. This is because larger females produce larger embryos that therefore have a higher survival rate. Only 50% of sexually mature females reach recruitment, meaning have offspring that will settle and grow into maturity and become part of the population. The average life span of a female Shortnose Spiny Dogfish is 0-29 years old while the male life span is 0-26 though it is estimated that a female can live up to 46 years while a male can only live up to 33. Females also take longer to reach sexual maturity than males and on average are not fertile until they are over 15 years of age.

The species name acanthias refers to the shark''s two spines at the leading edges of the two dorsal fins. These are used defensively.

Males and gravid females are usually found shallower than non-gravid females. The Spotted Spiny Dogfish tolerates brackish water and is found inshore in enclosed and open bays and estuaries, as well as offshore along the continental and insular slopes from the surface to 1,978 m, with most records occurring mainly between 10-200 m depth. It feeds on a diversity of prey, ranging from comb jellyfish, squid, mackarel and herring to a wide array of benthic fishes, shrimps, crabs and even sea cucumbers. In spite of its small size, the Spotted Spiny Dogfish is among the slowest-growing, latest maturing and longest lived of shark species. As a consequence, it is among the most vulnerable shark species to overexploitation by fisheries. It has one of the lowest intrinsic rates of population increase of any marine fish and this has contributed to the sharp collapse in its numbers. Once the most abundant shark species in the world, populations of Spotted Spiny Dogfish have declined dramatically.

Mating takes place in the winter months with gestation lasting 22-24 months. Litters range between two and eleven, but on average, six or seven. Size at birth is 18-30 cm. In the northeast Atlantic, pups are born in winter, with size at birth about 26-28 cm. Sex ratio at birth is 1:1. Gravid females congregate in enclosed shallow bays to give birth. The mother shark experiences a series of rhythmic contractions, just like in mammals, and the young are delivered headfirst. Larger older females have bigger litters with larger pups; a female with 100 cm TL carries on average 4 times as many embryos compared to a 70 cm female and the former have higher survival rates than those born to small females. Males mature at around 11 years of age, growing to 80-100 cm in length; females mature in 18-21 years and are slightly larger than males, reaching 98.5-159 cm.

They occur in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans and in the Mediterranean, most common in water temperatures between 21-30\u00b0C and generally between 30\u00b0 N and S latitudes. In southern Africa they are found throughout SA waters to 35\u00b0 south with occasionally large adults being caught off the Cape south coast but not in the Benguela system off the west coast and NAM but, however, are found in warmer oceanic waters further offshore. Dorado are largely nomadic although some pre-spawning migration has been proposed in the western and tropical areas of the Atlantic Ocean. Adults are epipelagic (the sunlit zone), wide-ranging in oceanic and shelf waters, sometimes aggregate under floating objects, often seen in pairs and may form small aggregations, normally close to the surface but can be found to depths of 85 m. Juveniles are pelagic (open ocean), and are often associated with flotsam but can sometimes drift into large embayments where their cryptic colouring provides good camouflage. Dorado are top predators that feed in surface water during the day. Adults feed on a wide variety of species, including small pelagic fishes, especially pelagic drifters such as juvenile trigger fish, juvenile tuna, billfish, jacks, pompano, and pelagic larvae of nearshore, bottom-living species crustaceans, nautilus, squid and a wide variety of planktonic organisms. They are also known to feed on flying fish, mackerel and small carangids. Juveniles eat planktonic organisms such as fish and crustacean larvae. Predators include large tuna, marine mammals, marlin, Sailfish, and Swordfish. Dorado are a highly prized commercial and  recreational species throughout its circumglobal range but seldom specifically targeted by commercial skiboat fishers but forms a major component of the recreational ski-boat sector in KZN, both by number (2.6%) and weight (9.8% and also comprises 1.02% of the catch by weight in the charter boat sector in KZN. It is often targeted around natural and artificial FADs and occasionally caught in the recreational ski-boat sector in the EC. It is caught as a bycatch in the pelagic longline fisheries in the SW Indian Ocean and forms a small percentage of the catch in the SA spearfishery. Due to low fishing pressure in SA, stocks are thought to be healthy and underexploited.", "biology": "Dorado are gonochoristic (separate sexes), multiple spawners, who exhibit sexual dimorphism; males growing larger and develop a steeper, squarer forehead than females. Breeding/spawning occurs mainly during summer, although spawning has been recorded throughout the year in tropical oceanic waters, often closer to shore. In the Atlantic they are known to spawn under patches of floating brown algae called Sargassum. They are believed to spawn every 2 to 3 days during the spawning season, releasing between 33,000 and 66,000 eggs each time. They are capable of reproducing at 3 to 5 months old off Florida and Barbados, but this varies considerably according to region. The length at maturity also varies considerably according to region but is normally around 65-70 cm FL for females and 75-80 cm FL for males. They can live up to 4 or 5 years but usually live less than 2 years. Atlantic Dorado can grow up to almost 2.134 m and 40 kg. The maximum recorded weight is 39,46 kg; the maximum recorded length is 200 cm FL but are more commonly found in the 100 cm FL range.", "citation": "SD Dunlop, BQ Mann In: Mann BQ. (Ed).

They also have a venomous spine protruding from their dorsal fin that is used for self-defense.", "about": "Elephantfish are the oldest group (420 million years) of jawed cartilaginous fishes and are also the slowest evolving genome of all vertebrates. They are a demersal (live and feed on or near the bottom of seas) marine species primarily living over soft substrata at a depth range of 10-374 m and are endemic from Namibia to KZN but primarily found along the Namibian, western and southern coast of SA and rare off KZN. Their movement patterns are nomadic with mature fish having an annual onshore/offshore migration for reproductive purposes. Juveniles are found predominantly inshore at <50 m. Both adults and juniors eat benthic invertebrates including bivalves, gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs), polychaetes (bristle worms), crustaceans and fish. Elephantfish are caught by directed gillnet and beach seine fisheries off the West Coast and in False Bay. Large numbers caught as a bycatch in the inshore trawl fishery. They are occasionally caught inshore by recreational boat and shore anglers and subsistence shore fishers during and following upwelling events. Decline in catches may be due to the \"silver trumpeter\" market collapsing, however substantial catches are now made by the inshore trawl fishery that used to be made by the beach seine and gill net fishery. Stock status further complicated by lack of life-history data, understanding of movement patterns, residency, sexual segregation and their status as a low value, bycatch species.", "biology": "These fish are oviparous (lay eggs) and in summer mature fish usually migrate inshore to mate after displaying courtship. Thereafter females deposit up to a maximum of 22 eggs in shallow and dissipative surf zones like St Helena Bay, a confirmed breeding ground. Their hairy brown spindle-shaped eggs are laid directly on the seabed, and it is not uncommon for many of them to wash up during the peak summer egg-laying season. Incubation time takes 9-12 months. Sperm storage inside the oviducal gland is likely and represents an advantage for deep-water species that exhibit sexual segregation. Semen plugs probably provide a competitive advantage. Males mature at age 3.3 years at 434 mm FL and females at 4.2 years at 496 mm FL.

In SA they occur along the entire southern African coast but less common between Cape Point and northern NAM, except within Saldanha Bay. The Angolan stock is genetically separate. They are migrants. Adult and sub-adult Elf migrate seasonally between the Cape and KZN. Adults are common in Cape waters during summer and autumn, and in KZN during winter and spring. The arrival of Elf in KZN coincides with the onset of spawning activity, suggesting a spawning migration. Northward migrating Elf also feed primarily on pilchards which undertake a similar annual migration northward from the Agulhas Banks. The migration of juveniles is thought to precede that of adults. Most, but not all Elf take part in the annual northward migration as some are caught all year round in the WC. Some Elf also remained resident in the Langebaan Lagoon for two years. Adults inhabit sandy and rocky substrata from the surf-zone down to 100 m. They also occasionally enter estuaries and harbours. Young-of-the-year juveniles prefer shallow subtidal embayments, less than 20 m deep, along the SE and SW Cape coasts. They exhibit feeding behavior called the \u201cbluefish blitz,\u201d where large schools of big fish attack bait fish near the surface, churning the water like a washing machine. Adults are primarily piscivorous, feeding on species such as anchovies, sardines, and grunts but also feed on crustaceans and cephalopods (octopus and squid). Juvenile Elf <10 cm consumes more crustaceans than fish. Elf is the most important species caught by recreational shore anglers along the entire eastern seaboard of SA. They account for approximately 28-80% of the annual reported catch in the recreational KZN shore fishery and also caught in fair numbers by subsistence shore fishers in the EC and by the beach seine fishery in the WC. They may be caught and sold in unlimited numbers by the traditional commercial boat-based fishery in all provinces except KZN where sale is prohibited. Generally, they are not taken in great numbers by boat-based fisheries except those operating in areas such as False Bay and Struisbaai in the WC. They are also taken as a bycatch in the KZN prawn trawl and inshore demersal trawl fisheries and occasionally by spearfishermen. Sharks, tunas, and billfish are typically the only fish predators large and fast enough to prey on adult Elf. Elfmake up a major part of the diet of Shortfin Mako Sharks and are also very important in the diets of Swordfish. Oceanic birds prey on juvenile bluefish. The two-month closed season is applied nationally between 1 Oct and 30 Nov, when the majority of Elf have migrated into KZN waters.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Elf are gonochoristic (separate sexes), batch spawners. Depending on their size, females can have between 400,000 and 2 million eggs. Breeding/spawning season: Spawning takes place multiple times in KZN between spring (Sep) and late summer (Mar) with peak spawning from Oct-Dec.

Their movement patterns are unknown but adults possibly migrate to shallow reef areas for spawning and are likely to move to deeper waters with age. Limited tag and recapture results for the undescribed Lethrinus sp. suggest a high degree of residency. Adults occur alone or in small shoals on coral and rocky reefs from 10 m down to 50-80 m, often found on sand between reefs and over the reef itself. Juveniles form large schools in shallow, sheltered sandy areas, including seagrass and mangrove areas. Adults feed on echinoderms (starfish, sea urchin, or sea cucumber), molluscs, crustaceans, polychaete worms and small fishes. The juvenile diet is similar. Given the recent realization that Blue Emperor is likely to be restricted to northern KZN, it is probable that the species only makes a very small contribution to recreational and commercial ski-boat catches in KZN. Previous reports of the species in SA are therefore primarily referring to the as-yet undescribed Lethrinus sp. Neither species appear to feature in recreational shorefishing nor spearfishing catches but Blue Emperors are caught by shore anglers from Kosi Bay northwards into MOZ waters and are taken by spearfishers in these waters. Blue Emperor probably makes a reasonable contribution to semi-industrial lineboat catches, recreational ski-boat catches and artisanal catches in southern MOZ, but it is not known what proportion of these reported catches include the undescribed Lethrinus sp.", "biology": "Their reproductive style has not been assessed in SA waters; some studies have suggested juvenile protogyny, which is effectively functional gonochorism, while others have considered the species to be a protogynous hermaphrodite (born female and changes sex to male). The breeding/spawning season has not been assessed in SA waters; several studies on FishBase indicate year-round spawning (no peaks), some report spring and summer peaks in both northern and southern hemispheres. The breeding/spawning locality occurs in shallow reef areas in tropical waters.

Length at 50% maturity: Ranging from 28-46 cm; based on several studies reported in FishBase; not studied in SA waters.

Densities of Devil Firefish vary depending on such factors as seasonality, local recruitment, local niche availability, and fishing pressure, but this species is often relatively abundant in parts of its range. It feeds on fish and small crustaceans. It has few predators, probably because of its venomous spines, but larger lionfish do prey on smaller ones. Moray eels have recently been identified as natural predators of Devil Firefish in its native habitat in the Red Sea. Some grouper species and reef sharks are also its predators. The fin spines are highly venomous and have caused death to humans in some reported cases. Despite this, a sting from this species is rarely fatal to humans. Nevertheless, a sting can cause extreme pain, vomiting, convulsion, minor paralysis, and breathing difficulties. Therefore, immediate emergency medical attention is strongly recommended, even for healthy adults who have been stung, as some people are more sensitive to the venom than others after being stung, and symptoms and reactions from the venom vary in severity from person to person.", "biology": "Max length: 35.0 cm SL.", "citation": "FishBase, The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Wikipedia"}',

Most fish are resident (90%) however a small percentage is nomadic. Nomads can move throughout the range. It is uncertain whether individuals adopt one or the other pattern i.e. residency or nomadism, or if all fish can adopt both patterns, but in unequal proportions. Adults favour broken surf (white water) in areas of mixed rock and sand but are also found in the surf-zone along sandy beaches and in kelp beds and sometimes found on offshore pinnacles in large shoals. Juveniles inhabit the immediate sublittoral (always submerged at low tide) surf-zone. Adults are epilithic (off the rock) feeders, principally molluscivores (a carnivorous animal that specialises in feeding on molluscs such as snails, bivalves, brachiopods - marine animals that have a pair of shells, which they can clamp shut for protection, with brown mussels dominating the diet and cephalopods (octopus or squid). The diet of juveniles is unknown. Galjoen are among the most common targets of recreational shore anglers in the WC and are also frequently targeted by spearfishermen. They are also taken illegally in gillnets on the west coast. Galjoen catch per unit effort (CPUE) recovered dramatically in De Hoop MPA shortly after its closure.

Adults feed on sardines (which are considered depleted), mackerel and massbanker while juveniles on shrimps and later anchovies. Geelbek are an important catch of the boat-based commercial and recreational linefishery. Catches per area are seasonal as adult fish undertake an annual spawning migration to KZN. They are also taken as bycatch by the inshore demersal trawl fishery. Despite the cut in commercial fishing effort and the decrease in recreational bag limits, the standardised CPUE does not indicate much of an improvement.

In southern Africa they are found along the entire eastern seaboard of SA. No population differentiation is observed between genetic samples from the EC to KZN, indicating that the different regions along the SA coast are highly connected. They are considered resident but despite making seaward migrations to spawn, Spotted Grunters are largely resident to one estuary. ORI tagging data revealed that 95% of recaptures were made within 3.5km of the release site and only 2% moved more than 100km. Acoustic telemetry studies have confirmed extreme residency by juveniles in both permanently open and intermittently open estuaries. Extreme weather events (with sharp barometric pressure drops) can displace resident individuals from their home estuaries.  Adults inhabit estuaries and coastal waters over soft sediments. Adults also venture into the river/estuary interface (freshwater), presumably to get rid of parasites. Juveniles can be found in estuaries, harbours, coastal embayments and shallow coastal waters. Spotted Grunter, which were rare in the Southwestern Cape are now commonly caught in this cool-temperate bioregion probably due to climate change. The adult estuarine fish\u2019s diet of consists of crustaceans and molluscs (e.g. sand prawn, mud prawn, pencil bait and the relative importance of the dominant prey varies between estuaries. In the Great Fish Estuary juveniles (< 300 mm TL) mostly consumed the endemic amphipod Grandidierella lignorum (63%) but also sand prawn (31%). In Durban harbor the diet included bivalve siphon tips, benthic crustaceans and polychaetes (bristle worms). Spotted Grunter are a very important recreational angling species in estuaries throughout its distribution from the Breede Estuary to Kosi Bay. Also, an important species in estuarine-based subsistence fisheries and illegal gill net and trap fisheries however less important in the coastal shore fishery and skiboat fishery. They are occasionally taken in the recreational spearfishery and as a bycatch of inshore trawlers on the Thukela Banks. The Stilbaai, Dwesa-Cwebe and Pondoland MPAs include no-take EPAs that benefit this species. The no-take wilderness areas in the Richards Bay, St Lucia and Kosi Bay estuarine systems are also likely to provide some protection for juveniles.", "biology": "Spotted Grunter are gonochoristic (separate sexes).

The broad and triangular pectoral fins have a deep indentation where their leading margins meet the head. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is much longer than the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower caudal fin lobe is more than half the length of the upper. The entire dorsal surface has a grainy texture from a dense covering of tiny dermal denticles. A thick ridge is present along the midline of the back, which bears a band of sharp, robust thorns. There is also a pair of thorn-bearing ridges in front of the eyes, a second pair running from above the eyes to behind the spiracles, and a third pair on the \"shoulders\".

This guitarfish spends most of its time near the sea floor but can occasionally be seen swimming in midwater. It favors sandy or muddy habitats, and can also be found in the vicinity of rocky and coral reefs and shipwrecks. It is a strong swimmer that propels itself with its tail like a shark. It is more active at night and is not known to be territorial.

Mouths are small and contain flattened, pavement-like teeth.", "about": "Giant Guitarfish are restricted to the Red Sea and tropical waters of the WIO south to SA. They are commonly found in KZN and the Pondoland area of the EC during summer, known to occur as far south as Knysna but seldom found south of Port St Johns. They are considered nomadic. Based on tagging data and shore anglers\u2019 catches, adults of this species appear to be fairly mobile. Although movement patterns are difficult to interpret, it is likely that they will move southwards down the coast during the summer months and return to northern KZN and MOZ with the onset of winter. Juveniles appear to show some resident behavior. Adults occur in shelf waters over muddy and sandy bottoms to 70 m but mainly off sandy beaches, where it is most abundant in the surf zone but does occur along the edges of reefs down to 30 m. Juveniles are mainly found in the surf zone along sandy beaches. Adults eat benthic molluscs, crustaceans, polychaetes (bristle worms), squid and small fish. The juvenile\u2019s diet is thought to be similar to that of adults. Giant Guitarfish are commonly caught by shore anglers in KZN and forms an important component of the competitive shore fishery where most fish are released. Also taken in shark nets along the KZN coast but most 150 (74%) are released alive. They comprise a small percentage (1.6%) of the bycatch taken by inshore prawn trawls off the Thukela Banks during summer. However, due to an extended closed trawl season implemented between Aug-Feb each year and diminished inshore prawn catches, the impact of the prawn trawl fishery on these has greatly diminished. Although this species faces fewer threats in SA, catches are seasonal occurring from October to May peaking in austral summer and it is possible that animals may also move to MOZ, where they are being increasingly targeted. Since the flesh and particularly the fins of Giant Guitarfish are highly sought after in Asian fish markets and the fact that the life history of this species makes it vulnerable to overexploitation. This is especially since they are targeted freely and often illegally by foreign longliners across a large proportion of its home range.

In SA they were previously thought to extend northwards up the west coast into NAM, but this may be as a result of misidentification with the Bluntnose Guitarfish (Acroteriobatus blochii). There is thus a possibility of two separate stocks, one in southern Angola to NAM and one along the south-eastern seaboard of SA. The latter population appears to have different colour variants with those in KZN having simple dark spots, while those in the EC and WC have brown spots ringed with white. Lesser Guitarfish are common in the surf-zone along sandy beaches during summer, but not in winter. It is possible that they move offshore into deeper water where they are taken as bycatch by inshore trawlers. A long shore movement is also possible. Adults inhabit sandy habitat - from the shallowest surf to inshore trawl grounds at depths of up to 73 m but have been recorded at a depth of 118 m off Sodwana. Juveniles utilise sandy surf-zones as a nursery. Adult\u2019s diet includes benthic invertebrates such as small crustaceans, sand mussels and polychaete worms. The juvenile\u2019s diet is unknown. Shore anglers catch this species mostly as bycatch, although they are sometimes targeted in catch and release angling competitions.

Scales are small.", "about": "Shallow-water Hake are distributed in the south-eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans on the continental shelf from southern Angola on the west coast to KZN on the east coast. They constitute the main stock in waters shallower than 300 m. The stock structure is uncertain. Differences in body and eye colour between NAM and SA populations suggest different stocks north and south of the environmental barrier off Luderitz. This proposed stock structure is supported by some, but not all genetic studies. They are residents where individuals move to deeper water with age so that the mean size increases with increasing water depth.  Adults utilize a wide range of habitats from rough, rocky bottom to sandy substrates. The main population resides in waters shallower than 300 m, but adults have also been recorded at 508 m during DAFF research cruises. The juvenile\u2019s habitat is similar to adults, but in shallower waters. Zero-year fish are often found in oxygen-deficient inshore waters e.g. off the Orange River. This could indicate a high tolerance to low oxygen conditions providing protection from predators. Adults are mainly piscivorous but may also eat cephalopods (octopus and squid) and crustacea. Most common prey is deep-water hake. Early juveniles prey on euphausids (shrimp-like planktonic marine crustaceans) and amphipods (crustaceans with no carapace) but become more piscivorous with increasing size; largely piscivorous diet from about 25 cm TL. The two hake species are the main target species of the offshore demersal trawl fishery, but about 70-80% of the hake catch is deep-water hake. Although Shallow-water Hake is less important to this sector, it nonetheless takes more than any other fishing sector. About 8% of the global hake TAC is allocated to the inshore hake trawl sector. Shallow-water Hake is the main target species of this fishery and is the dominant species in the catch; however the total catch is less than that taken by the offshore trawl sector. 10% of the global Hake TAC is allocated to hake longline plus hake handline. The majority of the hake catch taken by the hake longline and hake handline sectors is shallo-water hake, however many of the hake longline and hake handline right holders are not currently active due to the current economic climate. Some hake (mainly shallow-water hake) is taken as unavoidable bycatch in the midwater trawl fishery for horse mackerel. Current management is fully effective, and no further improvements are required.", "biology": "In common with other hake species this is a batch spawner.  Breeding/spawning season: All year, but with peak spawning in Sep-Oct. Breeding/spawning locality: Widespread on the continental shelf, but with some localised seasonal aggregations. Age at maturity: Males: 2.2 years; Females: 4.1 years; (SA west coast). Length at maturity: Males: 29.5 cm TL; Females: 46.8 cm TL; (SA west coast). Maximum recorded age: Female: 13 years; (SA south coast). This fish was a 99 cm TL female but larger fish that have not been aged have been recorded, so maximum age is likely to be greater than 13 years.

The caudal fin is angular in juveniles but becomes more rounded in larger fish. Colour: In life, silvery grey becoming darker above and lighter below; dorsal surface with a bluish bronze sheen that may become coppery on head. Larger fish (>80 cm) are golden brown; dorsal and caudal fins grey/brown, becoming darker with age, often with a reddish hue -due to vascular distension or haemorrhaging (possibly during capture). Pectoral and anal fins white in fish less than 10 cm, changing to yellow and finally to grey or grey/brown in fish greater than 35 cm, also becoming darker with size. Generally the goldish reen silver sheen quickly turns to a greyish brown colour when they die. Dusky Kob has a very peculiar strong metallic smell, and they excrete less slime compared to other kob after being caught. Mouth lining of juveniles is white, becoming yellow and finally yellowish grey in large adults. Axillary fold of pectoral fin is grey/black, generally with an irregular coppery-bronze patch. In general Silver Kob have longer pectoral fins than Dusky Kob. If the end of the pectoral fin exceeds past the end of the pelvic fin it is a Silver Kob. This is more distinct in older specimens. The other distinguishing characteristic is a thicker, shorter caudal peduncle (area between the body and tail) for the Dusky Kob. The base of Silver and Dusky Kob\u2019s pectoral fins are scaleless as well; except for the Sqaretail Kob; in this case their pectoral fin bases have scales.", "about": "Dusky Kob are distributed along the eastern seaboard of SA, southern and eastern seaboard of Australia; northern Indian Ocean off Pakistan and northwest coast of India; northern Pacific from Hong Kong northwards along Chinese coast to southern Korea and Japan. It is the largest of the kob species found in South African waters.  Dusky Kob are one of South Africa\u2019s most popular but severely threatened linefish species. In SA they are found along the southeast coast from Cape Point to southern MOZ, although it is most abundant from Cape Agulhas to northern KZN. Dusky Kob are considered migratory. Based on several tagging studies (i.e. ORI Tagging Project, unpubl. data and Childs in prep.), some fish are resident in specific estuaries and adjacent surf-zones and exhibit low levels of dispersal. However, a large proportion of the adult population from the EC and WC follows the \u2018sardine run\u2019 each year and migrate to KZN to spawn in winter/spring. Adults are found predominantly in the near-shore marine environment, from the surf-zone down to 50 m and possibly even 100 m but also frequent the lower-middle reaches of turbid estuaries (mostly deeper areas). Dusky Kob shows a strong affinity to estuarine habitats during early adulthood (up to the age/size at maturity of 6 years/~100 cm TL) and reduced estuarine use thereafter. They also school in the lower parts of estuaries and around river mouths during flood periods. Juveniles are estuarine-dependent and are euryhaline (able to tolerate a wide range of salinities). Early juveniles, 30-150 mm TL are found in estuaries only (mainly turbid and most often in the upper reaches). Juveniles 150-800 mm TL are predominantly found in estuaries (mainly turbid) but are also found in the inshore marine environment (mainly surf-zone). Larger juveniles (800-1 000 mm TL) are predominantly found in the inshore marine environment but are also found in estuaries (mainly turbid and most often in the lower/middle reaches). Adults are primarily piscivorous but also feed on cephalopods (octopus and squid) and crustaceans. Small juveniles (<50 mm TL) feed primarily on mysids (shrimps) and calanoid copepods (zooplankton, small crustaceans). Larger juveniles feed mainly on fish and mysids (shrimps). Diet also includes other crustaceans such as crabs, etc. Dusky Kob is one of the most important species in the recreational (estuarine and coastal shore angling as well as estuarine and inshore boat fishing), commercial and subsistence fisheries. They were found to be the primary target species in the EC recreational shore fishery and is prominent in the recreational shore fishery along the entire east coast of SA (Transkei and KZN), particularly in estuaries. Juveniles and sub-adults (<1100 mm TL) are commonly targeted by estuarine and surf-zone anglers, while adults are caught mainly by commercial and recreational ski-boat fishermen beyond the surf-zone. There is specific targeting of aggregations of these adult fish by ski-boats during late winter and spring in KZN, although surveys often don''t reflect this as catches are landed at night. Due to the similarity of the three kob species found in SA waters (i.e. Dusky, Silver and Squaretail Kob), regional differences in the regulations exist, particularly for boat-based fishers offshore. Due to the lack of enforcement and compliance, the bag and size limit restrictions are considered to be relatively ineffective. If precautionary measures advanced do not promote recovery, then a moratorium (a zero bag limit) and a shift to catch and release angling would be the only other option to ensure recovery of this collapsed stock.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Gonochorist (separate sexes). Breeding/spawning season: Oct-Jan in the EC and WC and Aug-Nov in KZN, however, the presence of Dusky Kob eggs has been documented in the coastal waters of KZN as early as July and as late as February. Breeding/spawning locality: Spawning aggregations occur on inshore reefs, pinnacles and wrecks (mainly at night) in KZN, Transkei and EC.

Three separate stocks have been identified in SA waters, one in the SEC, one in SC and one in SWC. Furthermore, a separate stock was identified in NAM. Silver Kob is the most abundant sciaenid species (a family of fish commonly called drums or croakers in reference to the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make) in South Africa. These migratory fish can be found inshore (<60 m) in summer dispersing further offshore in winter in response to oceanographic patterns. Adults inhabit mostly moderate/low profile reef in 20-120 m depth in SEC and SC and 2-120 m in the SWC. Juveniles are found on sand/mud substrata, recruiting into shallow embayments (5-10 m depth) but moving offshore with growth. Adults feed on pelagic fish, shrimp and squid while the juvenile\u2019s diet is unknown. Silver Kob is an important component of the commercial ski-boat fishery in the SWC, SC and SEC and a sought-after species for many recreational boat-based anglers, particularly in the SEC. In South Africa it is predominantly caught between Cape Point and East London. Between Cape Agulhas and the Kei River, they are only caught by ski boat anglers and trawlers in deeper water and not in estuaries or in the surf zone. In the colder waters along the Cape west coast and Namibia they are caught in the surf zone. It is also an important component of the bycatch of inshore trawlers along the SEC coast. The inshore trawl catch is in the same order of magnitude as the linefish catch but is not restricted by size limits. It is important in both the commercial and recreational linefishery in NAM where it is restricted to a depth of 1-20 m. It is also caught in the beach seine-net fishery in SWC. Current management measures appear to have had a positive impact on stocks.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Gonochorist (separate sexes).

Elsewhere they are replaced in the Atlantic Ocean by Altantic Chub Mackerel (Scomber colias) and by Blue Mackerel (Scomber australasicus) in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. In southern African waters Chub Mackerel is found from Angola to southern MOZ. It was thought that a single population represents the stock in the SE Atlantic but the connectivity between the Indian and Atlantic populations is uncertain. They are migrants.  Seasonal migrations are thought to be related to their breeding cycle - congregating in northern Benguela region in summer, migrating southwards during winter, and possibly migrating northward again towards the end of the year. Migrations could also be related to prey availability. Adults are a coastal pelagic species and to a lesser extent epipelagic to mesopelagic over the continental shelf and shelf slope to depths of 300 m. A shoaling species often found in mixed shoals of other species such as Pilchards, Maasbanker or other scombrids (mackerels, tunas, and bonitos). Juveniles can be found inshore, gradually moving into deeper waters upon reaching maturity. Adults feed on zooplankton such as euphausiids (shrimp-like planktonic marine crustaceans), mysids (various small, shrimplike, chiefly marine crustaceans) and copepods (crabs, shrimps, and prawns) and small fish and squid. Juveniles eat mainly zooplankton. Historically Chub Mackerel are taken mainly on handline. Since 1954 was an important pelagic species caught by commercial purse-seine and beach-seine net fisheries, also taken by mid-water and bottom trawlers, especially in NAM waters. However, very little caught by commercial purse-seiners since the mid-1970s and direct targeting by 174 of these vessels is not allowed. On average less than 350 mt per annum caught as a bycatch since 2000, contributing less than 1% to the entire purse-seine catch. They are frequently landed by recreational ski-boat anglers who often use them as bait. Healthy mackerel stocks will ultimately be dependent on the maintenance of suitable levels of abundance of forage species, especially Anchovey.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Gonochoristic (separate sexes).

It is an immigrant to the eastern Mediterranean by way of the Suez Canal. In SA they are common in MOZ and KZN waters, rarely extending as far south as Mossel Bay. They are migrants. Adults migrate southwards during summer (Nov-Mar) into KZN waters from MOZ and return during winter. This probably represents a feeding migration as little spawning has been recorded in KZN water. Adults are pelagic, extending from the edge of the continental slope inshore to shallow coastal waters. Younger fish tend to shoal in single cohorts. Juveniles have been recorded from large marine embayments in MOZ. Adults mainly feed on open water pelagic fish e.g. Clupeidae (herrings, shads, sardines), Carangidae (jacks and pompanos) and Scombridae (mackerels, tunas, bonitos) and will opportunistically feed on species such as lizardfish. Juveniles feed on small pelagic bait fish and crustaceans. King Mackerel are very important in the recreational and commercial ski-boat linefishery and spearfishery in KZN and MOZ. Historically, they were a prime target of the KZN commercial linefishery, however in recent years, primarily for economic reasons, it is has become more of an opportunistic catch in this fishery. They are rarely taken by recreational shore-based anglers.

When feeding or leaping, the Black Marlin may display light blue vertical stripes on the sides. The upper jaw produced into a robust but not a very long beak.  Slight variations in colour cause some specimens to have a silvery haze over the body.", "about": "Black Marlin are distributed throughout tropical and sub-tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific in temperatures ranging from 15-30\u00b0C. They are rarely reported from the Atlantic. During summer their extent reaches temperate waters. They are both coastal and oceanic. In southern Africa only one stock is thought to exist which is found throughout the Indian Ocean extending down the eastern seaboard of SA with occasional strays entering the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Cape. They are migratory; a highly mobile species which appears to move into higher latitudes during summer and returns to warmer, tropical waters during winter, but movement patterns appear not to be entirely predictable. In the tropical WIO, Black Marlin are more abundant during the north-east monsoon period (mid Oct - end Dec). Black Marlin are the most common marlin species in SA waters and is most abundant off the KZN coast during the summer months and is known to range as far south as Cape Point. Adult Black Marlin are oceanic and epipelagic, usually above the thermocline, often found close to land masses, islands and coral reefs at depths ranging from 0-200 m and are most common off KZN during summer especially around deep, submarine canyons that reach close to the shore. Juveniles are widely distributed by surface currents and are found predominantly in nearshore coastal waters. No juvenile Black Marlin have yet been positively identified in SA waters. Adults are powerful predators of pelagic shoaling fish, including tuna and squid. They take food at the surface but also at depths and occasionally near reefs. The diet of juveniles is unknown. Black Marlin are taken by pelagic longlines (44%) and drift gillnets (49%) throughout the Indian Ocean region, especially by China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Sri-Lanka and Indonesia: total catch reached 4, 569 mt per annum but is much less than other billfish species. They are an important recreational target species, caught by ski-boat anglers primarily off east coast of Africa including KZN but most are released. Little commercial harvesting of Black Marlin occurs from mainland Africa although foreign fleets do take this species as bycatch under license in the MOZ Channel and elsewhere in the SWIO. A highly rated game fish, the Black Marlin has the power, size, and persistence of which anglers dream. Fishing methods include trolling with large, whole baits (mackerel, bonito, flying fish, squid and others) or with artificial lures. Live bait is also effective. Catch and release should continue to be encouraged in the recreational linefishery and greater use of circle hooks should be promoted to enhance post release survival.", "biology": "Black Marlin are heterosexual where females grow bigger than males. They prefer temperatures 27-28\u00b0C for spawning and are highly fecund with a mature female producing in the order of 40 million eggs.  The breeding/spawning season and locality is unknown in southern Africa as no reproductively active Black Marlin have been recorded in SA waters. The age and length at maturity is unknown however weight at maturity is ~50-80 kg for males and >200 kg for females. The maximum recorded age is 13 years for males and 20 years for females. The maximum recorded weight is 707,6 kg (Peru 1953, IGFA) while in SA it is 354.2 kg (KZN 1987, SADSAA).

There are no spots on the fins.", "about": "Some taxonomists believed that the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Blue Marlins were closely related but separate species. They applied the scientific name Makaira nigricansto the Atlantic species only and the name Makaira mazara to the Pacific and Indian Ocean species. Others treated the two populations as subspecies, Makaira nigricans nigricans and Makaira nigricans mazara but now they are considered conspecifics: both known under the name of Makaira nigricans. The adults of this epipelagic and migratory species occur in tropical and temperate clear, warm surface oceanic waters >24\u00b0C above the thermocline, not usually found close to land masses or islands unless there is a steep drop-off of the shelf. In the Atlantic Ocean it is found from 45\u00b0N to 35\u00b0S, and in the Pacific Ocean from 48\u00b0N to 48\u00b0S. It is less abundant in the eastern portions of both oceans. In the Indian Ocean it occurs around Ceylon, Mauritius, and off the east coast of Africa and sometimes reaching as far south as Cape Town. Fish migrate into higher latitudes during the summer months, and seasonal concentrations occur in the Indian Ocean (0\u00b0-13\u00b0S) from April to October. Some evidence exists of migratory activity being greater in males.  Juveniles are also pelagic and oceanic, often found in association with warm currents. No larvae or juveniles have been positively identified off SA. Adults are top predators feeding on a diversity of epipelagic fishes, especially smaller tunas, frigate mackerel and squids. The juvenile\u2019s diet is unknown. Blue Marlin are an important bycatch component of commercial fisheries in the Indian Ocean being taken mainly by pelagic longlines (60%) and drift gillnets (30%) with remaining catches recorded by line (trolling). More recently, larger catches have been reported from the western and central tropical Indian Ocean and, to a lesser extent, the MOZ Channel and SA. The catches of Blue Marlin are typically higher than those of Black Marlin and Striped Marlin combined. The mean annual catch of Blue Marlin in the Indian Ocean over past decade was about 9 600 mt. Blue Marlin are occasionally captured by recreational sport fishermen off the KZN coast usually during summer (Nov-Mar) with most being hooked further offshore than other billfish species. A powerful, aggressive fighter, they run hard and long, sound deep, and leap high into the air in a seemingly inexhaustible display of strength. Fishing methods include trolling large whole baits such as bonito, dolphin, mullet, mackerel, bonefish, ballyhoo, flying fish and squid as well as various types of artificial lures and sometimes strip baits. Catch and release should continue to be encouraged in the recreational line fishery and greater use of circle hooks should be promoted to enhance post release survival.", "biology": "Blue Marlin are a heterosexual, dimorphic species with females growing considerably larger than males. The breeding/spawning season occurs in summer-autumn in southern latitudes < 30\u00b0S in the Indian Ocean but may spawn year-round in equatorial waters < 10\u00b0S.

Striped Marlin are smaller than other marlin species.", "about": "Striped Marlin is widely distributed in tropical and temperate waters of the Indo-Pacific and strays are occasionally found in the south-eastern Atlantic. It is the most wide-ranging of the Indo-Pacific marlins found between 45\u00b0N and 35-40\u00b0S latitude.  In the WIO they are densely distributed in the Arabian Sea, around Sri Lanka and in the MOZ Channel, extending southwards to the WC during summer. The Striped Marlin is seasonally migratory, moving toward the equator during the cold season and away again during the warm season. Migratory rates and patterns are, however, highly variable and preliminary genetic study suggests spatial partitioning of genetic variation and possible spawning site fidelity. Adults are pelagic and oceanodromous species usually found above the thermocline although it has been found to depths of 289 m. It generally inhabits cooler water than either Black or Blue Marlin. Abundance increases further offshore; usually seen close to shore only where deep drop-offs occur. It is mostly solitary but forms small schools by size during the spawning season. Juveniles are epipelagic; distributions appear to coincide with larval distributions in equatorial waters of both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Pacific juveniles migrate eastward to feed areas on the west coast of America. Adults are diurnal feeders of small shoaling fish (pilchards, anchovies, mackerel, and flying fish), crustaceans and squids. The juvenile\u2019s diet is unknown. Striped Marlin are caught mainly with pelagic longlines (98%) with smaller numbers taken by drift gillnets and trolling lines. They are not considered a target species but comprise an important bycatch for industrial fisheries in the Indian Ocean. Modest but unknown quantities taken by sport fishing, but most are released. Only of moderate importance in sport catches off SA, with most fish caught between Nov-Dec. Second most important billfish species (after Sailfish) caught by the sports fishery in Kenyan waters.

In addition to long runs and tail walks, it will \u201cgreyhound\u201d across the surface, making up to a dozen or more long, graceful leaps. It can be caught fairly close to shore and lacking the size and weight of the Blue Marlin or the Black Marlin, it is more acrobatically inclined.

Adults are also known to undertake extensive movements at sea in other parts of the world. Adults inhabit estuaries and coastal marine environment while juveniles are attracted to and are largely dependent on estuaries as nursery areas. Due to a reduction in freshwater flow and a 60% loss of floods, climate change, increased hydropower demands and freshwater abstraction in West Coast estuaries, juveniles of obligate estuary-dependent fish such as Flathead Mullet have declined in abundance to <10% of pristine level and are likely to decline to <5% under future flow projections.

The body has an overall silvery colour but is darker above and lighter below. There is a yellow blotch on the gill covers.", "about": "The Southern Mullet, or Harder, is distributed from Lobito (Angola) to the warm temperate, subtropical transition zone on the east coast of SA but rare in the eastern subtropical bioregion north of Port Edward or in western tropical waters to the north of Lobito. Harders comprise 98% of mullet biomass on the West Coast and until recently about 90% of that on the South Coast. They have dropped to 50-70% of mullet abundance on the cool- and warm-temperate South Coast but increased from less than 1% to 5-10% of that in the warm-temperate/subtropical transition zone of the East Coast. Similarly, they have increased from about 10% to more than 30% of mullet biomass in the warm-temperate/subtropical region of northern Namibia and southern Angola. They are nomadic but are \"resident\" in the surf zone and nearshore marine environment for most of the year but form large shoals in autumn and spring prior to movement, often in no apparent direction. East coast residency usually coincides with the development of surf zone phytoplankton patches during the summer months but disperse to feed on other food sources during winter. Adults inhabit the nearshore marine environment, surf-zone, estuaries, and lower freshwater reaches of river systems but have also been recorded more than 100km from the sea. This opportunistic species swims between optimum conditions to maximise benefits. It is also tolerant of adverse physico-chemical conditions, can survive salinity levels of 90ppt and practices surface breathing during hypoxic and anoxic events.  Juveniles are found nearshore, surf-zones, estuaries, and lower reaches of river systems. Estuary fish are physiologically healthier than marine ones. Adults have the mugillid gastric mill for processing food. Feed on detritus, benthic diatoms, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, epiphytes and surf-zone phytoplankton. Bioturbation by the sand-prawn reduces availability of benthic diatoms as food. Juveniles feed on zooplankton, benthic diatoms, surf-zone phytoplankton and detritus. Diet of post larval fish <20 mm consists mainly of copepods and macruran (crustacean) larvae. They are the main target of the gillnet fishery on the west coast, landing up to 1 500 mt per annum. Also they are a substantial illegal fishery landing more than 400 mt per annum, especially in the Berg Estuary. The legal gillnet fishery in the Olifants Estuary lands approximately 100 mt per annum. Also forms the main target of the beach-seine fishery on the west coast, current landed catches up to 1 000 mt per annum. They are also caught by the recreational, commercial, artisanal and subsistence linefisheries mainly by cast net but also by line and bottle trap and mostly used as live bait. They were a legal catch of the west coast purse-seine fishery until the 1980s. Nowadays, they are limited to incidental catches. There is a proposed experimental small-boat purse-seine fishery to assess its merits as an alternative to the gillnet fishery. Limited use as live bait (caught by cast net) by the tuna pole fishery, also used as dead bait for Yellowfin and Southern Bluefin Tuna. There was a brief lucrative market for high quality individually wrapped Harders as longline tuna bait. Shark Longline industry has expressed interest in using Harders as bait where it is occasionally used.", "biology": "The Southern Mullet is gonochoristic (separate sexes) spawning in nearshore, surf zones during spring and summer with early and late summer peaks which often intensify following atypical high summer rainfall in the winter and bimodal rainfall zones, the opening of temporarily open/closed estuaries and the escape of adults to the sea. Females and males grow at the same fast rate until the approach of maturity in the second year, whereupon female growth slows and that of males becomes negligible. Females attain greater size-at-age in all regions and continue growing to maximise reproductive output. Age at maturity: Combined sexes: 2-3years. Length at maturity: Combined sexes: 245-283 mm TL however, estimated length at maturity of 210-215 mm FL from the west coast and False Bay has also been reported.

Adults are found in the surf-zone, often near rocky areas and in estuaries while juveniles occur mainly in estuaries. The adult\u2019s diet in estuaries is dominated by filamentous algae, macrophytic plant material, epiphytic diatoms and foramaniferans. In the marine environment they also consume isopods and marine polychaetes (bristle worms). Juveniles have a similar diet to the adults, feeding mainly on filamentous algae, macrophytic (partly submerged) plant material and epiphytic (organism that grows on the surface of a plant) diatoms. Illegal gill netting in the Transkei region and other EC estuaries are likely to capture large numbers of Striped Mullet. In comparison, recreational angling will result in relatively small numbers of this species being captured. It is frequently caught by means of cast nets for use as live bait by recreational anglers and is the most common mullet species caught by shore anglers fishing along the KZN coast.", "biology": "Striped Mullet are oviparous (producing eggs that hatch outside the body).

They have powerful jaws with a set of impressive teeth - four cone-shaped teeth in the upper jaw and six in the lower jaw, as well as two rows of rounded molars in each jaw.", "about": "Black Musselcracker are endemic to SA occurring from south of Saldahna Bay Cape Agulhas to Cape Vidal. They are slow-growing, long lived, sex- changing and late maturing; a life history that makes them vulnerable to over-exploitation. MtDNA analyses have revealed that Black Musselcracker exists as a single, well-mixed stock throughout its distributional range. Based on conventional tagging data, both juveniles and adults of this species appear to be highly resident. However, large adults are known to move distances of over 100 km which also suggests the possibility of Black Musselcracker undertaking a spawning migration to Transkei waters, however this more likely involves a uni-directional movement up the coastline into Transkei and KZN waters where large adults live for the remainder of their lives. Adults inhabit deeper high-profile inshore and offshore reefs while juveniles are found in shallow subtidal reefs <10 m. Adults have an unspecialised diet with the most important prey groups being molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms (starfish, sea urchin, or sea cucumber). Gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs) and asteroids (starfish) are common prey items in sub-adult and adult Poenskop. Juveniles also have an unspecialised diet, with crustaceans being the most important prey item. Black Musselcracker are caught by shore anglers, spearfishers and recreational and commercial ski-boat fishers throughout its distribution. It is sought after by recreational fishers, but it is of little commercial importance due to low abundance, except in the Transkei, having comprised ~16% of total commercial landings in the Coffee Bay linefishery in 1985. However, this decreased to less than 1% in 1992, most likely due to a voluntary cessation of catch by commercial fishermen. Size of retained Black Musselcracker has decreased, with almost 100% of the catch, at present, weighing less than 5 kg. Catches of trophy fish by coastal recreational anglers were once common (especially in the Transkei) but are now extremely rare.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Assumed to be a protogynous hermaphrodite (changes sex from female to male).

The main stock is assumed to be between southern KZN and False Bay. They are migrants. Early juveniles (<150 mm) are resident in the intertidal and shallow inshore zone.  Juveniles and sub-adults (150 mm-550 mm FL) are resident in the inshore zone, while a proportion of the adult population (>600 mm FL) are thought to undertake a seasonal eastward spawning migration to Transkei and southern KZN. Adults inhabit high-profile, inshore reefs down to 20 m while juveniles are found in intertidal rockpools, gullies and shallow <12m subtidal reefs. Adults feed on gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs), echinoids (sea urchins), chlorophytes (green algae), crustaceans and polychaetes (bristle worms). Juveniles eat gastopods (snails, whelks and slugs), ascidians (sea squirts), echinoids (sea urchins), amphineurans (chitons), pelecypods (bivalves like oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops) and paguirids (hermit crabs). White Musselcracker are an important target species in the recreational shore fishery and spearfishery. They are occasionally captured in the subsistence shore fishery but seldom in the coastal ski-boat fishery. The sale of this species is prohibited and it is therefore of no commercial importance. White Musselcracker are an extremely important trophy fish for both the recreational shore fishery and spearfishery. Their limited inshore distribution, large size, slow growth, late maturity, longevity and aggregation during spawning events make this species extremely susceptible to overfishing. As with many linefish, accurate catch and effort monitoring is required to determine the population trends for this species. Such trends are considered essential for monitoring the status of this species as a per-recruit stock assessment will be difficult due to the unpredictability of catches.", "biology": "White Musselcracker is a large, late-maturing, slow growing, and long lived species. Reproductive style: Late gonochorist (separate sexes after maturity), (rudimentary hermaphrodite; possessing both male and female potential in the juvenile phase), known to aggregate during spawning.

Sardinops sagax has a wide anti-tropical distribution (exists at comparable latitudes across the equator but not in the tropics). This species occurs in coastal waters to a depth of about 200 m. This is a marine, pelagic and migratory species forming large shoals that may spread over several kilometers. With each year of life, migration becomes farther. It was previously thought that east coast Sardines represent a separate stock component that mixes with Sardines resident on the south coast during summer but then separates from them during winter to travel toward their east coast spawning grounds. Using genomic data, it was found that east coast Sardines were not unique, but clustered with west coast sardines, and were distinct from those on the south coast. This new finding suggests that Sardines participating in the run must be migrants that originate from the cool-temperate Atlantic, and are not actually well adapted to the warmer, subtropical conditions on the east coast. Observed variations in the geographical distribution of Sardine stocks associated with changes in population size are thought to be closely influenced by prevailing winds, currents and local phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations. The KwaZulu-Natal Sardine run is a mass migration of South Africa\u2019s commercially most important small pelagic fish from warm-temperate waters on the south coast to subtropical waters on the east coast. It is one of Earth\u2019s most spectacular marine migrations and is both ecologically and economically important.

It spends most of its time in less than 50 m of water. Devil Rays feed on planktonic crustaceans and small schooling fish, which are funneled into the mouth with cephalic flaps. When these flaps are rolled up, they look like horns, giving the animal a \"devil-like\" silhouette. The species exhibits large-scale movements, up to 1,800 km at minimum speeds of 63km per day. It is targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries. These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Their tendency to aggregate and their coastal and offshore distribution makes mobulids particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine and longline fisheries, targeted capture in artisanal fisheries, and incidental entanglement.

The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at a very obtuse angle on the snout, which has a barely protruding tip. The eyes are medium-sized and closely followed by larger spiracles. A short, broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin is present between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is wide and gently arched and contains four papillae (nipple-shaped structures) on the floor, the inner pair of which is shorter than the outer. The pelvic fins are small and narrow. The cylindrical, tapering tail lacks fin folds and measures slightly longer than the disc width. One to three serrated, stinging spines are located atop the tail, approximately one-quarter of the total tail length back from the base. The upper surface of the disc has a granular texture and bears a broad central band of closely spaced, flattened heart-shaped dermal denticles, beginning between the eyes, becoming widest at the \"shoulders\", and extending to entirely cover the tail. One or more rows of large, spear-like thorns also run along the dorsal midline from the center of the disc to the base of the sting. Barring the possible spotted variant, this species is a uniform yellowish brown above, with the disc margin and underside white, and the tail gray past the sting.", "about": "The Devil Stingray is patchily distributed in the Indo-Pacific region from South Africa to the Malay Archipelago to northern Australia. An inshore ray, usually found at less than 50 m depth, but also reportedly to 90 m. It feeds mainly on small bony fishes and crustaceans. It may be encountered alone or in groups; there is some evidence of segregation by sex. Because of its large thorns, the Jenkins'' whipray is highly prized for its skin; the meat and cartilage may also be utilized.", "biology": "Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy; with embryos feeding initially on yolk and then receiving additional nourishment from the mother by indirect absorption of uterine fluid enriched with mucus, fat or protein through specialised structures.

It is commonly found in coastal habitats at at least 60 m depth and swims close to the surface, occasionally leaping out of the water, or close to the bottom. It frequently forms large schools during the non-breeding season. Spotted Eagle Ray preys mainly upon bivalves, crabs, whelks, benthic infauna they also feed on mollusks, crustaceans, particularly crayfish] and also upon hermit crabs, shrimp, octopuses, and some small fish. The Spotted Eagle Ray''s specialized chevron-shaped tooth structure helps it to crush the mollusks'' hard shells. The jaws of these rays have developed calcified struts to help them break through the shells of mollusks, by supporting the jaws and preventing dents from hard prey. These rays have the unique behavior of digging with their snouts in the sand of the ocean. While doing this, a cloud of sand surrounds the ray and sand spews from its gills.

Adults inhabit rocky reefs from surf zones to 70 m but rarely recorded on coral reefs. Juveniles are found in tidal pools and inshore shallow reefs. Catface Rockcod are sedentary ambush predators that feed on fishes, crabs, and spiny lobsters and make a moderate contribution to ski-boat catches in KZN - ~3% by weight to both recreationals and commercials respectively; around 1% to spearfishing catches and 0.3% to recreational shorefishing; slightly lower contribution (1-2% by weight) to semi-industrial lineboat catches in southern MOZ.

They have recently been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a common tropical species found in a variety of coral reef habitats from tide pools to depths of at least 40 m. In the Gulf of Aqaba, Peacock Rockcod is found in social units comprising up to 12 adults, including one dominant male. Each group occupies a specific area (up to 2 000 m\u00b2) that is defended by the territorial male and subdivided into secondary territories, each inhabited by a single female. The preferred habitat of Peacock Rockcod is the 1-10 m reef zone. Primarily (75 to 95%) piscivorous, Peacock Rockcod has been blamed for numerous cases of ciguatera in the Pacific region. In the Red Sea researchers found that this species feeds mainly in the early morning and late afternoon; but at Madagascar, it appears to feed more at night. This common and widespread species is important to artisanal fisheries throughout the Indo-West Pacific region.

Its absence from the Persian Gulf is puzzling. Redbarred Rockcod is found on coral reefs and rocky bottom from the shore to depths of 160 m. At Madagascar it is one of the most abundant serranids at depths of 20-45 m, and it feeds during the day and night on brachyuran crabs, fishes, shrimps, and galatheid crabs in that order of importance.  Redbarred Rockcod from Kenyan waters ate crabs, stomatopods, fishes, ophiuroids, and octopus. Red Sea specimens consumed mostly fish and also some crustaceans (mainly crabs). Because of its abundance in shallow water, Redbarred Rockcod is widely used for food.

They are also reported from southern Madagascar and Mauritius, although these records are doubtful. The distribution of stock is primarily between Cape Point and Port St Johns. They are resident with small home ranges (<100 m linear extent). Adults inhabit deeper high- and low-profile inshore and offshore reefs to 100 m while juveniles are found on shallow subtidal reefs to 30 m. Adults feed on mainly echinoderms (starfish, sea urchin, or sea cucumbers), (sea lilies and feather stars and brittlestars) and cephalopods (octopus and squid) with some crustaceans (decapods - shrimp, crab, or lobster) and polychaetes (bristle worms). Juveniles eat mainly (bristle worms) with some small-bodied decapods (shrimp, crab, or lobster) and mysids (shrimp-like crustaceans). Roman are important to commercial and recreational ski-boat fisheries in WC and EC and are frequently speared by divers and occasionally taken by shore anglers fishing in deep water.  Despite a decline in total commercial catch between 1985 and 2007, Roman have sustained fishing pressure better than many other species of endemic sparid reef fish. It has been suggested that this is largely due to the small size at maturity (~180 mm FL) compared to the minimum legal size (272 mm FL; 300 mm TL). Furthermore, because of their small home range (1,000-3,000 m\u00b2) Roman can be effectively protected within small to medium sized MPAs.", "biology": "The male attracts a harem of females, with which he will mate. A large male is very aggressive and will defend his harem and territory against all intruders, including competitive males.

Sex change takes a little longer. Reproductive style: Protogynous hermaphrodite (changes sex from female to male). The species forms pairs before an elaborate courtship ritual and spawning, the eggs being released well above the seafloor. Breeding/spawning season: Oct-Jan (EC).

Densest concentrations of Sailfish are found near large land masses or offshore islands. Juveniles are also epipelagic, often close to the surface at night and appear to be closely associated with warm currents. Sailfish usually travel alone or in small groups. They appear to feed mostly in midwater along the edges of reefs or current eddies. They are only targeted as gamefish in sport fisheries but valued as bycatch in artisanal and commercial fisheries throughout their distribution. They are caught using a number of methods including trolling lures strip baits, feathers or spoons, as well as live bait fishing and kite fishing, longlining, gillnets, harpooning etc. The most action is found where Sailfish are located on or near the surface where they feed. Off SA, Sailfish are primarily targeted by recreational ski-boat anglers in northern KZN. Their fighting ability and spectacular aerial acrobatics endear the Sailfish to the saltwater angler, but it tires quickly and is considered a light tackle species. Recent acoustic tagging and tracking experiments suggest that this species is quite hardy and that survival of released specimens is good. Catch-and-release angling by sport fisheries and use of circle hooks is encouraged to reduce post-release mortality.", "biology": "Sailfish are heterosexual; females usually grow larger than males. Spawning occurs with males and females forming pairs, or two or three males with one female. Spawning may occur throughout the year with a peak in summer in tropical epipelagic shelf waters. Little reproductive activity is observed in KZN waters. Sailfish mature at ~3 years however the sample size of data collected during opportunistic sampling was modest.

Smalltooth Sawfish live in tropical seas and estuaries (semi-enclosed areas where rivers meet the sea) of the Atlantic Ocean. They rely heavily on very shallow, warm, saline coastal waters fringed with dense mangrove roots, and sometimes enter the lower reaches of freshwater river systems. Smalltooth Sawfish populations have declined dramatically due to habitat loss associated with coastal development and accidental capture in fisheries. Smalltooth Sawfish also are listed as a migratory species threatened with extinction (Appendix I) under the United Nations Environment Programme Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Participating countries strive to strictly protect these animals, conserving and restoring the places where they live, and mitigating obstacles to migration. Smalltooth Sawfish eat a variety of fish and invertebrates (e.g., shrimp and crabs).  They use their rostra to slash through schools of fish, swinging it from side to side to impale and stun prey. Their rostra also contain electro-sensitive organs, which can sense the weak amount of electricity produced by other animals. These organs likely help sawfish find shrimp and crabs on the seafloor. Ongoing public, political, and financial support is also integral to preventing further sawfish extinction.", "biology": "Smalltooth Sawfish are \"yolk-sac viviparous\". Their young are attached to yolk sacs that nourish the embryo inside the mother''s body and emerge as fully developed pups. The pups are born with their saw fully developed, but it is very flexible and sheathed in a thick gelatinous material to avoid injuring the mother at birth (the sheath dissolves quickly thereafter). A mother Smalltooth Sawfish can have 7 to 14 pups per litter. Newborn sawfish are approximately 610 mm long at birth and double in size over their first year.  Sawfish reach sexual maturity at around 7 years and when they\u2019ve grown to about 335,3 cm long. The length of the female Smalltooth Sawfish gestation period, or pregnancy, is believed to be 12 months and females can give birth every other year.

Through overfishing the former range of Seventyfour has contracted to the area between Sodwana Bay and the central Agulhas Banks with the centre of adult distribution being deep offshore reefs (>40 m depth) between Durban and East London. While juvenile Seventyfour appear to be fairly resident (ORI Tagging Project, unpubl. data), adults undertake an annual migration from Cape waters into Transkei and southern KZN during winter to spawn. This migration could also be in response to the seasonal migration of one of their prey, the sardine, into KZN waters. There is also the possibly of a return migration of the adults to the Cape after spawning but this has not been confirmed. Adults frequent deep offshore reefs (40-160 m) forming dense shoals, often found in association with ledges and pinnacles.  Juveniles are found on offshore reefs deeper than 20 m in the EC and WC. Adults are primarily piscivores feeding on pelagic species such as sardines and mackerel but their diet also includes reef fish, cephalopods (octopus and squid) and crustaceans. Juveniles feed mainly on invertebrates such as mysids (various small, shrimplike crustaceans). Throughout the 20th Century Seventy-four was intensively targeted by commercial and recreational linefishing vessels (firstly by lineboats and later by ski-boats), especially on their spawning grounds in southern KZN contributing up to 70% of linefish catch. By the late 1960s the fishery in KZN, which was made up predominantly of large adult fish, had collapsed and only relatively small quantities continued to be caught in the EC. Catches in the SE and S Cape also declined considerably. A stock assessment was conducted in 1996 based on historical data collected during 1962-63 which showed that stocks had already collapsed by the 1960s. Based on this evidence and the fact that CPUE had declined by more than 90% throughout its distribution, a moratorium was placed on the catching of Seventyfour in 1998 to allow stock rebuilding to take place. A reassessment of the Seventyfour stock was conducted in 2007, 10 years after the implementation of the moratorium. This study showed little evidence of recovery of the adult spawning population in KZN accept that there was a slight increase in mean size of adult fish. There was however, evidence of inceasing numbers of juveniles in the EC suggesting that stock rebuilding is taking place. A rolling yearly moratorium is now in place until further scientific evidence, currently being undertaken, is available.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Rudimentary hermaphrodites (the female reproductive organs come to maturity before the male) and thus functional gonochorists (separate sexes).

The Illovo Banks just south of Amanzimtoti on the KZN south coast was a well-known spawning aggregation site that was heavily fished by lineboats operating out of Durban Harbour after the 2nd WW.

In southern Africa they occur from Cape Point, northwards to the Red Sea, including around Madagascar. Due to the absence of certain life history stages from catches suggests differences in sex ratio and migratory behavior between sexes. Some evidence exists for site fidelity and for philopatry (the tendency of an organism to stay in or habitually return to a particular area) for nursery areas among female Blacktip Sharks on the US Atlantic coast. Adults are regarded as pelagic but not truly oceanic. On the KZN coast they penetrate the surf zone and occasionally St Lucia Estuary as well as offshore and are seldom caught in water >30 m. Young animals may use coastal waters of MOZ. Elsewhere they are known to use coastal waters, including estuarine salt marshes and tidal creeks as a nursery. Adults eat mostly fish however but exhibit differences in diet with changing geographical areas and seasons. Important pray species include sardines and mackerels. There is no known commercial fishery but unconfirmed reports of some targeting on the KZN coast. Blacktip Sharks are caught by recreational shore and boat anglers and are ranked third (in terms of numbers) of all requiem sharks caught by competition anglers in KZN and northern EC. Blacktip Sharks are extremely popular with anglers because they take a variety of live and dead bait, lures and even flies. They are an outstanding game fish at all sizes and known for their determined runs and their tendency of making spiraling leaps. A mean annual catch of 97 sharks was taken in the protective gill-nets (shark nets) off KZN beaches between 1978 and 2010. This species appears to be responsible for extensive depredation on hooked linefish in the commercial and recreational ski-boat linefishery in KZN.

In southern African waters they are known to occur from NAM to East London. They are nomadic. ORI Tagging Project data showed that Broadnose Sevengill Sharks appear to have a random movement pattern with no clear patterns. Recaptured animals on the NAM coast showed a lower mean distance travelled (24 km) compared to those on the Cape west coast (50km) and those on the S Cape coast (144 km). However, the relatively high percentage of Broadnose Sevengill Sharks recaptured at the same locality to where they were tagged (38%) suggests that some individuals may be fairly resident or that they regularly return to the same areas. Other studies have shown high levels of site fidelity. Adults are found on continental shelves to 50 m, however large individuals have been found at depths of up to 570 m. Juvenile\u2019s habitat is unknown in SA. Inshore bays are recorded as being important for juveniles in California. Anecdotal evidence from recreational shore anglers indicates that Betty''s Bay in the WC may be an important aggregation site for juvenile Broadnose Sevengill Sharks. Adults >180 cm TL feed on Chondrichthyans (fishes with a cartilaginous skeleton), marine mammals, fish and miscellaneous (crustaceans, bivalves and algae). Juveniles <120 cm TL eat the same except for marine mammals. Broadnose Sevengill Sharks are often caught in organised recreational shore angling catch and release competitions in the WC to accrue points for personal and club records. They may be of some importance in the commercial linefishery when fish catches are low. Because the price per kg is low and the demersal shark longline industry has agreed not to retain Broadnose Sevengill Sharks, but catches may be retained when catches of more valuable species are low. Slow growth, late maturity and their inshore distribution render this species potentially vulnerable to overexploitation.", "biology": "These animals are ovoviviparous/aplacental viviparous (internal fertilization and the young ones are born alive; no placental connection; the unborn young are nourished by egg yolk; the mother''s body does provide gas exchange).

The mouth has short, subtle furrows at the corners and contains 29-35 upper tooth rows and 29-33 lower tooth rows. The teeth are serrated with single narrow cusps; the upper teeth have a distinctive hooked shape and become more angled towards the corners of the jaw, while the lower teeth are upright.

The first dorsal fin is tall, with a pointed apex and a concave trailing margin; its origin lies about even with the tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is small and low, and positioned about opposite to the anal fin. There is usually no ridge between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe.

In southern Africa two discreet populations were considered: one from the south WC eastwards and the other from just south of Walvis Bay northwards. Recent genetic work however shows no differences in population genetic structure between NAM and SA samples, but differences were evident when compared with Australia/New Zealand and Peru populations. Bronzies are thought to be migratory who penetrate KZN waters in winter during the annual \"sardine run\" but their movement patterns remain unclear. They are often targeted by competitive shore anglers and are mostly released alive. Adult copper sharks are captured in the protective shark nets in KZN and are occasionally caught by pelagic tuna and Swordfish directed longlines as well as taken in the demersal shark longlining fishery, midwater trawls, inshore and offshore demersal trawls and pilchard purse seines as a bycatch, but there is some uncertainty regarding identification.

In southern Africa they are found from the Breeda River to MOZ. Recent satellite telemetry has indicated that individuals can move large distances (e.g. from the WC to MOZ). However, it is suspected that the Bull Shark is a seasonal resident in some areas (e.g. on certain reef systems), but the degree and extent of residency and migration are uncertain. Adults are found in coastal waters including inshore and offshore reefs, the surf zone, estuaries, rivers while juveniles and newborns appear to be confined to their nursery areas in coastal lagoons, turbid estuaries and rivers. Adults are indiscriminate, especially in larger individuals; there is a shift towards elasmobranches with increasing size. Sea turtles, marine and terrestrial mammals, birds, crustaceans and cephalopods (octopus and squid) are occasionally taken. Juveniles show a very strong preference for fish and smaller sharks taken in rivers and lakes. Fish also dominate the diet of smaller sharks caught in the sea. Sea turtles, mammals and invertebrates are occasionally taken. Bull Sharks are important in the competitive shore fishery, primarily in KZN but extending into the EC; but most specimens are released. They are also caught year-round in the bather protection nets of the KZNSB but mainly in summer. Some recreational ski-boat anglers target this species around Protea Banks in southern KZN. Like many elasmobranch species, Bull Sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation due to its life-history characteristics.", "biology": "Bull Sharks are aplacental viviparous (eggs that are fertilised and hatch inside the female shark but the embryos lack a placental connection to the oviduct or uterus and so do not feed off the mother initially and ingests the yolk at the beginning until one side is covered in blood vessels that grow with the uterine wall creating a yolk sac placenta. Thereafter the nutrients in the mother\u2019s blood are shared via that placenta). They give birth to live young. A prolonged mating and early pregnancy season is possible in both summer and winter and takes place north of KZN. Evidence suggests a pupping season between Nov-Feb.

In southern Africa they are found around the entire SA coast its regional distribution is centered in the SW Cape. It occurs on the continental shelf and often ventures into shallow water, but is capable of oceanic movement.  SA white sharks have shown a number of different movement types. These include rapid trans-oceanic return migrations (Western Australia), frequent long-distance coastal return migrations, smaller-scale patrolling and site fidelity. Recapture of sharks tagged in KZN and the SW Cape showed evidence of site fidelity or repeated use of migratory routes. Adults are pelagic and wide ranging inhabiting coastal and shelf waters but are occasionally oceanic. They are intolerant of low salinity environments. Juveniles inhabit similar environments to adults. Adults have a highly varied diet with marine mammals (whale, dolphin, porpoise, sea lions and seals), bony and cartilaginous fish and cephalopods (octopus and squid) being the most important. They are opportunistic; scavenging off whale carcasses is common but also takes sea turtle sand sea gulls. Juvenile\u2019s diet is similar to adults. Prior to full protection of this species in 1991, trophy hunting for extremely large individuals in the SW Cape was a major source of mortality. Currently approximately 33 individuals, almost all of which are immature, are caught annually in the KZN shark nets. Increased targeting of juveniles by shore anglers in the SW Cape has been reported recently; the animals are generally returned alive, but mortalities through capture stress are unknown.", "biology": "The Great White\u2019s reproductive style is through aplacental viviparous development (separate sexes where embryos develop inside eggs remain in the mother''s body until they are ready to hatch). Embryos are oophagous, deriving their nourishment from the ingestion of packets of unfertilised eggs. Very few pups in a litter survive until birth due to this form of sibling cannibalism. Nothing is known about the shark\u2019s breeding/spawning season, given the very small number of mature animals examined in SA, of which only one female was \"apparently\" mature. The capture of a 140 cm TL (20 kg) individual and sighting of small individuals (approx. 150 cm TL) in Algoa Bay suggests that the EC, and specifically Algoa Bay, may represent a nursery ground for this species.

Different from other hammerheads, they have an indentation in a central location on the front part of their arched head. Two more indentations flank the main one, giving them a scalloped appearance. The pelvic fin has a straight posterior margin while the anal fin is deeply notched on the posterior margin. The second dorsal fin has a posterior margin that is approximately twice the height of the fin, with the free rear tip nearly reaching the origin of the upper caudal lobe.

Pups have been reported to \u2018tan\u2019 in the shallow waters of their nurseries, darkening in colour.", "about": "This is the most common of all sharks in the hammerhead family. As adults, Scalloped Hammerhead Sharks occupy both coastal and offshore ocean waters. They have a circumglobal distribution in coastal warm temperate and tropical seas; in the eastern Atlantic from the Mediterranean Sea to Namibia. Distribution in the Indo Pacific includes from South Africa to the Red Sea, throughout the Indian Ocean. In southern Africa they have been recorded from northern MOZ to the northern region of the EC. They are migratory. Only 13 recaptures (1.81%) out of 717 tagged with a mean distance travelled of 157 km (ORI Tagging Project). These results suggest large-scale migrations within SA waters, probably in response to seasonal sea surface temperature changes. Horizontal migration is observed from inshore bays to a more pelagic habitat as the sharks grow. This species is segregates by sex, with females migrating offshore earlier and at smaller sizes than males. Adults are found mainly over the continental shelf, ranging from the surf-zone and near the surface, to far offshore and to depths of at least 275 m. Juveniles are generally found in sheltered coastal zones, often near the bottom, occurring at high concentrations during summer in large open estuaries and bays. In SA most juveniles have been recorded on the Thukela Banks and in coastal waters off the former Transkei. The adults diet is dominated by teleosts (ray-finned fishes), but other elasmobranchs (sharks) and cephalopods (octopus or squid) supplement their diet. Crustaceans, birds and gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs) have also been recorded in a few specimens. Juveniles (<130 cm PCL) seem to have a more varied diet with fewer elasmobranchs being consumed. Scalloped Hammerhead Sharks are commonly caught as a bycatch by recreational shore anglers and forms an important component of the competitive shore fishery in KZN and the former Transkei, but most are released. They are occasionally caught offshore by commercial and recreational ski-boat anglers and also in estuarine embayments. They comprises a large percentage (21%) of the elasmobranch bycatch taken by inshore prawn trawls off the Thukela Bank during summer, however, due to an extended closed trawl season between Aug-Feb and diminishing inshore prawn catches, the impact of the inshore prawn trawl fishery has diminished. They are the third most numerous shark caught (~166.year) in bather protection nets off certain KZN beaches. Both artisanal fisheries operating inshore and foreign vessels offshore (longliners) off MOZ target Scalloped Hammerhead Sharks for its flesh and fins. A small percentage (<0.6%) are caught as bycatch in the tuna and Swordfish longline fishery off SA. They are threatened by commercial fishing, mainly for the shark fin trade.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta (eggs are fertilised and hatch inside the female shark but the embryos lack a placental connection to the oviduct or uterus and so do not feed off the mother). Breeding/spawning season: The gestation period is around 9-12 months, with pupping in spring and summer (Oct-Mar). Breeding/spawning locality: Adult females move inshore to give birth to live young (pups), who then remain inshore during their early life stages; Thukela Bank in northern KZN and other similar shallow nursery areas.

Smooth Hammerhead Sharks are commonly caught in the competitive shore fishery but most are released. They are occasionally caught as bycatch by inshore commercial and recreational ski-boat anglers. A number of individuals (74.8 yr) are caught in the protective gill-nets (shark nets) off certain KZN beaches. A small percentage are caught as bycatch (<0.6%) in the tuna and Swordfish longline fishery, while comprising less than 3% of the catch in the shark directed longline fishery. Since the flesh and fins are highly sought after in Asian fish markets large numbers of longline vessels have been reported to be operating illegally in coastal waters of the western Indian Ocean, primarily targeting hammerhead sharks.

Breeding/spawning season: Little is known in SA waters but pupping is thought to be mainly in summer (Oct-Mar) due to the increased catches over this period. Breeding/spawning locality: Not known with certainty in SA waters. However it is reported a female specimen that appeared to have recently mated in Feb off central KZN and another female from the EC caught in Nov that contained full-term embryos.

It can be easily distinguished from all other sharks by its teeth, which are like curved daggers with no cusps at the base or serrations along the razor shark edges. The front surface is flat and the teeth are curved inward. The back of the Shortfin Mako is a brilliant metallic blue gray or cobalt blue and the sides are light blue, changing to snowy white on the belly including the lower jaw. The longfin mako is also blue above with light blue sides, but is white below except for the jaw and also has much longer pectoral fins and larger eyes, and the area on their snout is darker. In life the Mako''s colours are the most strikingly beautiful of all the mackerel sharks. After death the colours fade to grayish brown.", "about": "Shortfin Mako Sharks have a circumglobal distribution in temperate and tropical seas. In southern Africa they are found around the entire SA coast. Genetic differentiation in mitochondrial DNA across global populations has resulted in a partially segregated population structure. North Atlantic tagging studies have revealed seasonal migrations and trans-Atlantic movements exceeding 3 920 km which make them highly migratory. Adults are coastal epipelagics found in depths of 1-500 m. Juveniles are pelagic, higher catch rates observed along the 200 m isobath on the Agulhas Bank. Shortfin Mako Sharks are aggressive predators that feed near the top of the food web on marine fishes such as Bluefish, Swordfish, tuna, and other sharks. They have few predators, mainly larger sharks that may prey on smaller Shortfin Mako Sharks. Adults are opportunistic feeders praying on pelagic cephalopods (octopus and squid), pelagic fish (including billfish), crustaceans, small cetaceans (whale, dolphin, or porpoise), small sharks, and are sometimes cannibalistic. Sharks caught nearshore in KZN preyed mainly on elasmobranchs, including Milk Sharks, Dusky Ssharks and Spotted Eagle Rays. Sharks caught far offshore in KZN preyed mainly on fish. Most common in stomach samples were Maasbanker and Sardine. Juvenile\u2019s diet is similar to adults. They are targeted in the large pelagic longline fishery and by recreational game fishermen. This species is taken in relatively high numbers as bycatch in both the pelagic tuna- and Swordfish-directed longline fisheries and are also caught in the protective shark nets set approximately 500 m offshore of swimming beaches along the KZN coast. The Shortfin Mako Shark is a known enemy of the Broadbill Swordfish. In one case a 331 kg mako was found to have swallowed a 54 kg Swordfish whole. It has been implicated in attacks on humans and is the undisputed leader in attacks on boats. A hooked mako will unleash all its fury, reportedly leaping as high as 10 m out of the water. It may roll, shake, dive, and charge the boat. It has also been known to bite the boat and occasionally to leap into it, causing severe injuries to the angler and wreaking havoc in the cockpit.", "biology": "Shortfin Mako Sharks are ovoviviparous (eggs are hatched within the body of the mother who gives birth to live pups) and oophagous, deriving their nourishment from the ingestion of packets of unfertilised eggs. Parturition occurs in late winter to early spring in both hemispheres. Little is known about the location of their breeding/spawning but it is speculated that these sharks move inshore to breed. Males mature at 7-9 years and at 185-199 cm FL (165 cm PCL); Females at 14-21 years when at 253-275 cm FL (220 cm PCL). The maximum recorded age for males is 21-34 years and 28-38 years for females; studies from various regions throughout their distribution.

They are nomadic with the greatest distance travelled of 363km, the mean distance moved of 87.5km and the maximum rate of travel 28km/day (ORI Tagging Project), however, these data should be used with circumspection, given the similarity to other requiem sharks commonly caught by shore anglers, specifically baby Spinner Sharks. Adults are found from close inshore to depths of 200 m and are especially abundant in summer off the sandy beaches of northern and central KZN, usually occurring in midwater or near the bottom. They are sometimes found in estuaries but not in fresh water. They probably use the surf-zone for protection from larger shark species. Juveniles occur in shallow bays in surf-zone off sandy beaches in northern KZN.  Off north eastern Australia they have been documented using shallow, muddy embayments as nursery grounds. Adult\u2019s diet consists of small fish, cephalopods (octopus and squid), gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs) and crustaceans; the juvenile\u2019s diet is similar to adults. It is likely that there are diet shifts with increasing size which is related to intra-species competition as recorded with other requiem shark species. Milk Sharks are seldom targeted by recreational shore anglers and mostly caught as a bycatch, except during shore angling competitions. Few are consumed and most are discarded. They comprises a small percentage (3.7%) of the bycatch taken by inshore prawn trawls on the Thukela Banks during summer and are occasionally caught as a bycatch by recreational and commercial boat fishers, usually discarded but sometimes kept for bait and forms a small percentage of the catch taken by subsistence shore fishers in northern KZN. This species is most abundant in the Durban to the Umfolozi River region.", "biology": "Milk Shark\u2019s reproductive takes place through mating with distinct pairing and embrace and are viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta (eggs are fertilised and hatch inside the female shark but the embryos lack a placental connection to the oviduct or uterus and so do not feed off the mother). They bear 2-8 pups per litter (mean = 4.7) after about one year gestation. Pups are 25-39 cm at birth. Pupping is recorded from Nov-Jan (summer) in KZN waters and they are thought to use shallow embayments, such as around Richards Bay and elsewhere on the KZN north coast. Males mature at 1,8 years (68-72 cm TL); females at 2,3 years (70-80 cm TL) in KZN and southern MOZ  however populations from different areas show slight differences with regard to size at maturity.

The eyes are large and black, without nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The small, S-shaped nostrils are positioned in front of and below the level of the eyes. The mouth is large and strongly curved, with moderately protrusible jaws. North Atlantic sharks have 28-29 upper tooth rows and 26-27 lower tooth rows, while Southern Hemisphere sharks have 30-31 upper tooth rows and 27-29 lower tooth rows. Each tooth has a strongly arched base and a nearly straight, awl-like central cusp, which is flanked by a pair of smaller cusplets in all but the smallest individuals. The five pairs of gill slits are long and precede the pectoral fin bases. The pectoral fins are long and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) are at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch is near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin. The dorsal colouration is a medium to dark gray or slate, extending to the bases of the pectoral fins. The underside is white; adults in the Southern Hemisphere often have dark colouring under the head and dusky blotches scattered over the belly. The free rear tip of the first dorsal fin is abruptly light gray or white, a feature unique to this species.", "about": "The Porbeagle has an anti-tropical and disjunct distribution (it is absent from the tropics), occurring in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere in temperate and cold-temperate waters. Porbeagles do not occur in the North Pacific. It prefers cold, temperate waters below 18\u00b0C. It is migratory, moves generally along the continental shelves (inshore to surface during summer) and winters offshore in the open ocean in deeper water to depths of 1,809 m. It is most abundant on continental offshore fishing banks but also found far from land in ocean basins and occasionally closer inshore. Fast and energetic, the porbeagle can be found singly or in groups. It feeds on small and medium-sized pelagic schooling species, other sharks, squid and demersal fishes (cod, white hake, red hake, haddock and cusk). It is psome Prized for its meat and fins; the porbeagle has long been under heavy fishing pressure.

The upper front teeth are separated from the teeth on the side of the mouth by small intermediate teeth.", "about": "Spotted Raggedtooth Sharks are wide-ranging in warm-temperate and sub-tropical coastal waters of the eastern and western Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea and Indo-West Pacific but are absent from the central and eastern Pacific Oceans.  In SA they have been occasionally reported from the west coast, but are more commonly found along the east coast from Cape Town to northern KZN. They are migratory; mature female sharks undergo a well-defined biennial reproductive migration along the east coast, which can be traced through the spatially and seasonally distinct phases of mating, gestation and parturition. Adults inhabit the continental shelf down to 190 m, but are most commonly found at depths of 10-40 m in sandy-bottomed gutters or gullies, and in rocky caves in the vicinity of inshore reefs and islands. Juveniles tend to inhabit inshore reefs primarily within Eastern and Southern Cape nursery areas. Tag recapture data suggests that juvenile sharks may exhibit natal nursery homing and be site-specific to summer nursery areas. They are less migratory than adult sharks and tend to remain in the nursery areas for the first 4-5 years of life Spotted Raggedtooth Sharks are opportunistic feeders, consuming a wide variety of teleost fish as well as smaller elasmobranchs. They occasionally consume invertebrates such as squid, crabs and lobsters and are considered to be ambush predators. Observations also suggest that this species feeds co-operatively by forming packs and concentrating prey prior to attack. The juvenile\u2019s diet is similar. Although protected from commercial fishing in SA since 1998, bycatch in any fishery potentially poses a threat to its survival. Because this species typically inhabits shallow inshore areas, it is rarely, if ever, caught by the large-scale industrial fisheries operating on the high seas. Its near-shore distribution, however, coupled with its fish-eating habits, makes it susceptible to the small-scale, multi-species fisheries (recreational shore anglers, recreational and commercial skiboat anglers). Most catches by shore anglers are released alive. Protective legislation in the form of decommercialisation was specifically introduced to prevent its capture and sale (especially of the fins) by boat anglers. Adults are caught in fairly large numbers in the bather protection nets of the KZN Sharks Board during their reproductive migrations. Spotted Raggedtooth Sharks have suffered severe population declines across much of its range as a result of over exploitation since they have one of the lowest rates of reproduction among elasmobranchs. The full recovery of stocks is expected to require decades. Given the critical status of this shark across much of its distribution globally, the South African population may be the last remaining, healthy and relatively pristine population of this widespread but vulnerable top predator.", "biology": "Spotted Raggedtooth Sharks are an ovoviviparous and aplacental species (embryos develop inside eggs that are retained within the mother''s body until they are ready to hatch), with the developing embryos obtaining nutrition through both oophagy (egg eating) and uterine cannibalism which results in a maximum fecundity of two pups per litter after a gestation period of approximately 9-12 months. Breeding/spawning season: Mating occurs in Oct-Nov. Pregnant females then move northward to spend the first part of their gestation in the warmer waters of northern KZN and possibly southern MOZ. From June onwards the near-term pregnant females begin to move southwards towards the cooler pupping grounds of the EC where they give birth to two pups from Sep-Nov. Breeding/spawning locality: Females move from the EC to mating grounds on the KZN south coast. Much of the pregnancy is spent in northern KZN and possibly southern MOZ, followed by a move southwards to the pupping grounds of the EC. The pups are born at a total length of 95-120 cm. The young-of-the-year and juvenile sharks remain in the geographically disinct nursery areas for their first 4-5 years of life, before joining the subadult and adult components of the population.

  '{"other_names": "School Shark, Oil Shark, Vitamin Shark, Snapper Shark", "appearance": "This species has a slim, streamlined body with a distinctive, long, slender and pointed snout, its length equal to or greater than mouth width. The eyes are small and circular. Prominent, forward-pointing furrows occur at the corners of the mouth. The tooth rows number 15-18 in each half of the upper jaw and 14-17 in each half of the lower jaw, with two and one tiny symphysial (central) teeth, respectively. The teeth have long, narrow central cusps and are finely serrated in the upper jaw and smooth in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are long. The first dorsal fin is relatively small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists between the first and second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The colouration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the Blacktip Shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.", "about": "The Spinner Shark occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and the Indo-West Pacific Oceans. It is coastal and pelagic in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental and insular shelves at depths of 0-200 m. It is a highly migratory species that occurs more frequently in inshore rather than offshore waters and has nursery grounds in shallow, near-shore waters. The spinner shark is a fast, active swimmer that sometimes forms large schools, segregated by age and sex. Young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures to adults. Off South Africa, females are found close to shore year-round, while males only appear during the summer. They are often confused with the Blacktip Shark.  Spinner sharks feed primarily on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They have also been known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey is seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark''s momentum at the end of these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. In South Africa, the Spinner Shark is caught incidentally by pelagic longline, commercial and recreational line, prawn trawl fisheries, and the beach protection program.", "biology": "Like other requiem sharks, the spinner shark is viviparous. Adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional uteri; each uterus is divided into compartments, one for each embryo. The embryos are initially sustained by a yolk sac. When the embryo grows to around 19 cm long, the supply of yolk has been exhausted, and the empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which the mother provides nutrients for the remainder of gestation. This species has the smallest ova relative to the fully developed embryo of any viviparous shark known. Females give birth to three to 20 (usually seven to 11) pups every other year, after a gestation period of 11-15 months. Mating occurs from early spring to summer, and parturition, from April to May off South Africa. Young are birthed in coastal nursery areas such as bays, beaches, and high-salinity estuaries in water deeper than 5 m. Length at maturity: 210.0 cm, range 170-266 cm.

It has a stout body and a short, blunt nose with widely spaced nostrils. It has particularly catlike eyes and small, tightly packed pointed teeth that form a pavement-like structure for crushing the shells of crustaceans, and small, sharp central cusps for hooking other prey. They usually have many black spots, but juveniles and some adults have few to none.", "about": "Spotted Gully Sharks are endemic to southern Africa from central Transkei to northern NAM, extending to southern Angola. They are mainly distributed from the WC to the EC in shallow waters. They prefer shallow marine reefs <50 m but may penetrate into marine dominated estuaries e.g. Kromme Estuary. They are mostly residents although a few records of movements of over 200 km have been recorded (ORI Tagging Project). Adults prefer inshore rocky reefs <30 m, may penetrate estuaries that are effectively marine inlets. Juveniles occur on shallow reefs along the SE and S Cape coasts. Adults feed on crustaceans (crabs), cephalopods (octopus and squid) and reef fish. Juveniles eat mainly rock crabs. Spotted Gully Sharks are mainly taken by recreational shore anglers, especially in competitions, but are generally released. This endemic shark is distributed close inshore in temperate waters. Late age at maturity and low reproductive capacity make this species highly vulnerable to overfishing.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Aplacental viviparity (embryos develop inside eggs that are retained within the mother''s body until they are ready to hatch), 5-15 pups. Breeding/spawning season: Mating and fertilization from Oct to early Dec. Estimated gestation period is 20 months, the entire reproductive cycle may be 2-3 years. Breeding/spawning locality: WC to the EC in shallow waters <30 m. High concentrations of small juveniles have been observed near East London. Pupping probably occurs along much of the S Cape coast.

It is present near the surface at night and makes deep dives during the day. They are oceanic, pelagic and near bottom at 1->500 m range. They feed on pelagic fish (lancetfishes, herring, mackerel and small billfishes) and bottom fishes like hake and squids. The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to the likelihood of post-release mortality especially for tail-hooked animals. The bigeye thresher is highly susceptible to over-exploitation due to its low lifetime fecundity.", "biology": "Reproduction is by aplacental viviparity with distinct pairing with embrace, with embryos feeding on other ova produced by the mother (oophagy) after the yolk sac is absorbed.

They are not regarded as an oceanic species but do occur far offshore. In southern Africa they occur from MOZ down to Cape St Francis, listed as the southernmost limit of its distribution. They are nomadic. Data from the ORI Tagging Project shows that most recaptures have been taken in relatively close proximity to where they were originally tagged, while others have undertaken long distance movements. In other regions individuals maintain large home ranges but return to specific areas on a regular basis there is thus also some evidence for this behaviour in KZN. Adults are found in coastal and far offshore in warm temperate and tropical waters.  It is assumed that the largest individuals are found in lower latitudes, making such excursions during the warmer summer months. Juveniles are found in coastal waters in tropical regions. There are no known nursery areas for Tiger Sharks on the SA coast. Adults Tiger Sharks have one of the most diverse diets of any known shark species, which includes marine mammals, sea birds, elasmobranchs, fish and cephalopods (octopus and squid). It is also a well-known scavenger. Juveniles are restricted to smaller prey such as cephalopods and smaller fish. They are rarely caught as bycatches in KZN shore and recreational boat fisheries. On occasion they have been targeted by the commercial ski-boat fishery on the central KZN coast. Approximately 60 (mainly immature) individuals are caught each year in the KZN bather protection program; survival rate is high with about 25 sharks released alive.  Small congregations of Tiger Sharks are the focus of baited dives in the Aliwal Shoal MPA. Tiger Sharks are also relatively common in the St Lucia and Maputaland MPAs. Much controversy surrounds the shark diving industry that has developed within the Aliwal Shoal MPA, and careful management is required to ensure that Tiger Sharks do not become conditioned by reward feeding.", "biology": "Tiger Sharks are the only species of requiem sharks to display aplacental viviparous development (eggs that are fertilised and hatch inside the female shark but the embryos lack a placental connection to the oviduct or uterus and so do not feed off the mother initially and ingests the yolk at the beginning until one side is covered in blood vessels that grow with the uterine wall creating a yolk sac placenta. Thereafter the nutrients in the mother\u2019s blood are shared via that placenta). Mating occurs mainly in spring with gestation lasting 13-16 months and pupping occurring during the following summer.

Associated almost exclusively with coral reef habitats, Whitetip Reef Sharks are most often encountered around coral heads and ledges with high vertical relief, and additionally over sandy flats, in lagoons, and near drop-offs to deeper water. They prefer very clear water and rarely swim far from the bottom. Unlike other requiem sharks, they can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. An individual shark may rest inside the same cave for months to years. Whitetip reef sharks generally remain within a highly localized area; only rarely do they undertake long movements, wandering for a while before settling down somewhere new. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5\u02daC.", "biology": "Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta, (once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment for the remainder of gestation) small litters of 1-5, and a size-at-birth of 52-60 cm TL.

The colour pattern in young sharks is dark brown above and light yellow below, with vertical yellow stripes and spots. As the shark grows to 50-90 cm long, the dark areas begin to break up, changing the general pattern from light-on-dark stripes to dark-on-light spots. There is substantial variation in pattern amongst adults, which can be used to identify particular individuals. A rare morph, informally called the Sandy Zebra Shark, is overall sandy-brown in colour with inconspicuous dark brown freckles on its upperside, lacking the distinct dark-spotted and banded pattern typical of the species. The appearance of juveniles of this morph is unknown, but subadults that are transitioning into adults have a brown-netted pattern. Faint remnants of this pattern can often be seen in adult Sandy Zebra Sharks.", "about": "The Zebra Shark is broadly distributed in inshore waters of the continental and insular shelf of the Indo-West Pacific. It is usually found within a narrow band of shallow coral reef habitat and soft bottom at depths down to at least 62 m. The Zebra Shark is found in inshore, shallow coastal areas including mudflat, mangrove and seagrass beds as juveniles and then move further offshore to coral and rocky reef areas as adults.  Adults and large juveniles frequent coral reefs, rubble, and sandy areas. They are often observed resting on the bottom as well as swimming near the surface as both juveniles and adults. The Zebra Shark demonstrates seasonal movement patterns in subtropical locations towards the latitudinal extent of their distribution. Regular seasonal movements of between 1,000 -2,000 km have been recorded although it also demonstrates strong site fidelity to particular reefs in Australia and sometimes cross oceanic waters to reach isolated seamounts. They are rather sluggish, at least during the day and probably nocturnal. They feed mainly on mollusks, but also small bony fishes but are also known to eat crustaceans (crabs and shrimps) and sea snakes.", "biology": "The courtship behavior of the Zebra Shark consists of the male following the female and biting vigorously at her pectoral fins and tail, with periods in which he holds onto her pectoral fin and both sharks lie still on the bottom. On occasion this leads to mating, in which the male curls his body around the female and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for two to five minutes. The Zebra Shark is oviparous, with females laying large egg capsules measuring 17 cm long, 8 cm wide, and 5 cm thick. The egg case is dark brown to purple in colour and has hair-like fibers along the sides that secure it to the substrate. The adhesive fibers emerge first from the female''s vent; the female circles vertical structures such as reef outcroppings to entangle the fibers, so as to anchor the eggs. Females have been documented laying up to 46 eggs over a 112-day period. Eggs are deposited in batches of around four. Males attain sexual maturity at 150-180 cm long, and females at 170 cm long. Their lifespan has been estimated to be 25-30 years in the wild. Reproductive seasonality in the wild is unknown. Max length: 354 cm TL.", "citation": "FishBase, The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Wikipedia"}',

It is found from areas close inshore to a depth of 800 m, although they are most common at depths of 100-300 m. They prefer sandy areas and are found in shallow enclosed bays and on the continental slope. This skate migrates towards the coastal shallows during the warm season and towards deep waters in winter. They spend most of their time lying flat on the sand, where they are well camouflaged.  Like other species a range shift southwards has been observed and ascribed to the combined effects of climate change, habitat destruction and/or fishing. This skate feeds on invertebrates, including crustaceans, bony fishes and fish offal. It is utilized for its meat which is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein. The pectoral fins are sold as ''skate wings''. It is caught by shore and ski-boat anglers and by hake trawlers. In Namibia it has been used by some shore-based anglers as bait for large sharks, a practice which is strongly discouraged.

Its natural habitats are open large seas and shallow seas with a variety of substrates, including mud, sand, shingle, gravel and rocky areas, in water down to 300 m but usually at depths between 10-60 m off coastal areas. It is sometimes seen trapped in large estuarine pools at low tide.  It is a nocturnal species which undertakes migrations with mean distances of 54-117 km per month and shows a clear annual migration cycle moveing from deeper offshore waters (10-30 m) in autumn and winter to shallower areas (<10 m) in spring). Young are non-migratory, inhabiting inshore nursery grounds where they are found to remain in shallow waters for at least 2 years. It is probably one of the most common rays encountered by divers. Juvenile fish feed on small crustaceans, particularly amphipods and bottom-living shrimps; adults feed on crabs, shrimps and small fish.

Paired eggs are laid and deposited on shallow sand, mud, pebble or gravel bottoms. Up to 170 egg cases can be laid by a single female in a year, but average fecundity is much lower (around 48-74) eggs. Egg cases are oblong capsules with stiff pointed horns at the corners, each containing one embryo. Capsules are 5.0-9.0 cm long without the horns and 3.4-6.8 cm wide. Egg cases are anchored with an adhesive film. Embryos feed solely on yolk. Egg cases hatch after about 4-5 months and pups are about 11-13 cm TL.

Reports from Madagascar need to be substantiated.  The core of the stock lies between Ponta Zavora in southern MOZ and Coffee Bay in the EC. ORI tagging data shows a high level of residency in older, larger Slinger (>4 years old), relatively few of which have undertaken extensive migrations. However, it is possible that young Slinger (0- 4 yrs) migrate northwards from juvenile nursery areas in southern KZN and northern Transkei towards MOZ. This hypothesis remains untested as small Slinger (<300 mm FL) are too small to tag using conventional spaghetti tags. Adult Slinger is abundant on offshore rocky reefs from 20-130 m. Small juveniles <50 mm FL observed on shallow reefs in 10-30 m off Pondoland in the EC, juveniles >50 mm FL widespread on reefs along the KZN coast in 20-60 m. Adults are opportunist benthic carnivores feeding mainly on crustaceans and molluscs, but also prey on small fish and echinoderms (starfish, sea urchin, or sea cucumber). Juveniles eat small benthic crustaceans including decapods (shrimp, crab, or lobster), amphipods (beach fleas, sand hoppers), copepods (small or microscopic aquatic crustacean), mysids (crustaceans with a carapace over most of the thorax), etc. and echinoderms (starfish, sea urchin, or sea cucumber) including crinoids (sea lilies and feather stars), ophiuroids (brittlestars) and echinoids (sea urchins). Slinger is the most important species caught in the commercial linefishery off KZN and southern MOZ, but is also important to the recreational ski-boat fishery in KZN and southern MOZ.  While the life history characteristics of Slinger make it vulnerable to overexploitation, it has shown a positive response to management intervention by way of effort reduction in the KZN commercial linefishery.  However, as this is a shared stock, a similar reduction in commercial fishing effort is required in southern MOZ to ensure long-term sustainable use of this important resource. On-going monitoring of catch and effort is required. An increase in suitable reef area included in no-take MPAs in southern MOZ and northern KZN will undoubtedly benefit and add resilience to the adult spawning population of Slinger. It is highly susceptible to barotrauma, and its survival is limited after being caught at depths greater than 10 m which reduces the effectiveness of a minimum landing size.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Protogynous hermaphrodite (changes sex from female to male) with serial spawning.

In southern Africa they occur from Angola to Algoa Bay. They are nomadic; adults move offshore (between 150-450 m isobaths) in winter/spring to spawn. Their long shore movement is generally random. Adults inhabit the mesopelagic zone (twilight zone) along the shelf and near islands and seamounts to depths of 550 m. They often occur near the bottom during the day and migrate to the surface at night. Juveniles are epipelagic (sunlight zone) occurring in shelf waters shallower than 150 m off Cape Columbine and east of Danger Point. Adult Cape Snoek prey on a wide variety of demersal and pelagic organisms, including fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (octopus and squid). The prey composition is dependent on fish size and area. Smaller juveniles feed on fish larvae, while larger juveniles feed on fish such as sardines and anchovies as well as euphausiids (shrimp-like planktonic marine crustaceans). Cape Snoek is the main target of the commercial linefishery along the west coast and off the SW Cape where it comprises over 40% of the landed catch.

Red Steenbras can be reddish, bronzy or golden-yellow in colour; young with a dark blotch behind dorsal fin. This powerful fish has large canine-like teeth and a fusiform shape. Adult males become more yellow in colour with black markings on the head and back. About the Species Red Steenbras are endemic and are found from False Bay to St Lucia. They are the largest member of the seabream family. The stock has been greatly reduced and now is seldom caught in KZN and WC waters with the core of the remaining adult stock occurring in the former Transkei and Border regions of the EC. Tagging data has shown that juveniles (<700 mm FL) are resident on reefs in the WC and southern parts of the EC. On attaining maturity, adults migrate eastwards to the former Transkei and southern KZN. The existence of an annual eastward spawning migration is indicated by sequential catch seasons along the Cape and Transkei coast but there is no evidence of a return migration. An offshore migration has also been proposed between the inshore and offshore Agulhas Banks but lacks confirmation from tagging data. Adults inhabit offshore rocky reefs in 50-160 m between Cape Agulhas and southern KZN. Juveniles are found in shallower inshore reefs (10-50 m) between Cape Point and Kei Mouth. Adults are apex predators on deep reefs feeding mainly on reef fish such as cheilodactylids (butterfish, fingerfins), clinids (blennies) and small sparids (sea breams and porgies). They also feed on squid, octopus and crustaceans such as slipper lobster. Small juveniles feed on mysids (various small, shrimplike crustaceans), carids (crustaceans) and gobies (a small marine fish that typically has a sucker on the underside), while larger juveniles feed mostly on reef fish. Red Steenbras was historically important in both recreational and commercial ski-boat catches throughout its distribution. More recently (prior to the commercial closure of the fishery in Nov 2012) it only comprised a relatively small component of recreational and commercial ski-boat catches in most areas except the Border and former Transkei regions of the EC where it still forms an important component of the recreational catch.

In SA they are common along WC and EC coasts. Adults are found on sandy substrata from the surf zone down to 50 m and tend to be found in water deeper than 10 m. Juveniles inhabit the shallow surf zone <10 m and utilize large marine bays in the EC and WC as nursery areas and recorded from estuaries but usually associated with the mouth region of permanently open systems. Adults are generalist carnivores feeding on a wide variety of prey including polychaetes (bristle worms), bivalve molluscs, echinoderms (starfish and sea urchins), gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs) and fish. Juveniles are also carnivorous feeding predominantly on polychaetes (bristle worms) but become more generalistic with size.  Although fairly commonly caught by shore anglers along the EC and WC coasts using light tackle, they are generally not targeted due to their small size. They comprised a substantial component of the beach-seine fishery in False Bay up until the prohibition on night-fishing in the early 1990s.

The crossbars fade with age.", "about": "White Steenbras are endemic from Orange River Mouth to KZN. There is some evidence for presence in NAM but needs to be confirmed. Hypothetical historical west coast spawning populations are functionally extinct through beach-seine and gillnet fishery overexploitation. DNA analysis indicates that White Steenbras exist as a single, well-mixed population. The main portion of the stock is located inshore and in estuaries along the EC and WC coasts. White Steenbras are migratory. Small juveniles (<50 mm) enter estuarine nursery grounds along the Cape coast between September and November, remaining there for up to 2-3 years before re-entering the marine environment. Late juveniles (post-estuarine), (>150 mm) are resident in surf zone of sandy and mixed shores. Sub-adults (>500 mm FL) begin to undertake large-scale migrations up to 400 km, although a large proportion remains resident.  After about five years they mature at a length of 650 mm TL, when they commence annual migrations. During autumn and early winter these mature fish migrate eastwards to near the north-eastern limit of their distributional range to eastern EC, to spawn during late winter. Although not empirically confirmed, not all mature fish migrate. The return migration takes place during spring and large numbers of mature fish arrive in the South-Western Cape during summer. Many fish return to the Western Cape where they spend the summer. Adults inhabit the inshore marine environment to depths of 25 m and range from the Orange River to the Mtamvuna Estuary, predominantly on sandy or mixed sand and rock shorelines. Early juveniles inhabit obligatory estuarine-dependent nursery phase, up to ~3 years. They are resident within estuaries, with high site fidelity and are limited mainly to estuaries from Berg Estuary (WC) to Mbhanyana (EC) and use mainly lower sandy reaches of estuaries. Sub-adults and adults in marine environment eat polychaetes (bristle worms), crustaceans, particularly crabs, molluscs (mainly sand-dwelling bivalves), mysids (shrimp-like crustaceans) and echinoderms (starfish and sea urchins). Juveniles in estuaries eat annelids (ringed worms or segmented worms), algae, copepods (small crustaceans), ostracods (crustaceans such as crab or lobster) and brachyura (crabs). They appear to feed on shallow banks at night in estuaries. Juveniles in surf zones eat amphipods (beach fleas, sand hoppers), mysids (shrimp-like crustaceans), macrurans (lobsters, crayfishes, shrimps, and prawns), polychaets (worms) and bivalves. White Steenbras are caught primarily by shore anglers in WC and EC. They were a major component of shore catches in the WC from 1930s to 1990s and were responsible for approximately 50% of total annual catch by mass and 75% by number. A commercial ban on White Steenbras was implemented in 2001. Recreational boats in estuaries now land low numbers of White Steenbras relative to other angling species, although the majority retained is undersized, and historically White Steenbras formed a large component in recreational, and competition catches in certain estuaries.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Rudimentary hermaphrodite (possessing both male and female potential in the juvenile phase), functional gonochorist (separate sexes when adult). Breeding/spawning season: Late winter, Jul-Aug.  Single spawning period theory supported by timing of recruitment being later in the year in estuaries further west.

An isolated population in Langebaan Lagoon (Saldanha Bay) frequents channels with sandy bottoms in <10 m depth. Juveniles are found on shallow subtidal reefs, sometimes entering estuaries. Adults are omnivorous and feed on a variety of invertebrates (especially crustaceans) and algae. There is a shift towards carnivory with size. Juvenile fry feed on zooplankton but become omnivorous as they grow. Steentjies are not a preferred target of either the line or trawl fisheries, as they are generally too small to market. However, linefishers do retain Steentjies usually for own consumption or in the absence of catches of more profitable species. They are often used for bait. They are seldom taken from the shore.

They can be found inshore in summer dispersing further offshore during cooler winter months. The offshore migration is related to reproductive seasonality. Adults are found in spring and summer in shallow water in the vicinity of sandy beaches, estuary mouths, coastal lagoons and sand and mud flats but in winter they move offshore and are found at depths down to 110 m. Females give birth to pups inshore, the juveniles then move offshore for their first one to two years. The adult diet varies depending on size and habitat. Within the surf-zone the main prey items include mud shrimps, small, edible saltwater clams, marine bivalve mollusks and bristle worms. Beyond backline the main prey are acorn worms and mud shrimps. The juvenile diet is unknown. Blue Stingrays are a popular target species for recreational shore anglers, especially during shore angling competitions and occasionally taken by both recreational and commercial ski-boat fishers but are normally discarded. Juveniles are caught offshore as a bycatch by inshore trawlers in the SE and SW Cape. Adults are sometimes caught as a bycatch in beach seines in False Bay and off Durban beach.

Adults and juveniles are caught as a bycatch in beach seine fishery off Durban. Due to its vulnerable life-history characteristics (large size at maturity, large maximum size, low fecundity, preference for shallow water, dependence on estuarine nursery areas, etc.), the Honeycomb Stingray requires careful management, and consideration should be given to de-commercialising this species. Furthermore, global trends indicate that stocks are declining due to over-exploitation, specifically because it is a retained bycatch in many fisheries.", "biology": "The Honeycomb Stingray is ovoviparous (internal fertilization and the young ones are born alive, no placental connection, the unborn young ones are nourished by egg yolk; the mother''s body does provide gas exchange). After a 12 month gestation period 3-5 pups are born alive in summer with a disk width of 28-30 cm. Although little is known about the locality, it is thought to breed in shallow waters off sandy beaches in northern KZN and MOZ. Newborn pups are sometimes caught in estuaries and sheltered sandy bays along the KZN north coast. Little is known about age at maturity.

It was described as a distinct species in 2008.", "appearance": "The Leopard Stingray is a large species reaching 1.4 m across and 4.1 m long. It has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc wider than long and rather thick at the center, with narrowly rounded to angular outer corners. The leading margins are sinuous and converge to a broadly triangular snout; the tip of the snout protrudes as a distinct, pointed lobe. In juveniles the disc is nearly equal in length and width. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger, roughly rectangular spiracles. Between the long, narrow nostrils is a wide, skirt-shaped flap of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The mouth is strongly bow-shaped, with shallow furrows at the corners. There are four short papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor of the mouth, as a central pair and a much smaller outer pair; papillae are also found on the lower jaw. The teeth are small, conical, and blunt, numbering around 59 rows in the upper jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are S-shaped. The pelvic fins are fairly slender; males have stout claspers. When born, this species is grayish to brownish above with large black spots, a row of dark spots on either side of the tail until the sting, and beyond it alternating dark and light rings. The spots hollow out at around a disc width of 55 cm, such as large juveniles and adults are mostly covered by a leopard-like pattern of large, dark brown rings on a yellowish-brown background. The dark and light rings on the tail fade ventrally to become saddles. The underside is uniformly white.", "about": "The Leopard Stingray is demersal on soft substrates and is mainly inshore and coastal though it also occurs on the continental shelf to at least 81 m depth. The Leopard Stingray is caught across its range as target and incidental catch by a wide range of coastal fisheries that include demersal trawl, Danish seine, gillnet, dropline and longline, and handline gears. It is retained in some parts of its range for meat and high-value skin. Its preference for inshore coastal waters increases its susceptibility to capture and so it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. In South Africa, catches of this species are relatively small and have been consistently less than one t annually since 2010 (DFFE 2022). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.", "biology": "The biology of this species is poorly known, partly due to confusion with other species of the \u2018uarnak\u2019 species complex. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by uterine milk produced by the mother. Sexual maturity is attained at 70-80 cm across for males.

  '{"other_names": "", "appearance": "The Pelagic Stingray has a very thick, distinctively wedge-shaped pectoral fin disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediately behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection at the center of the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 25-34 upper tooth rows and 25-31 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back. The whip-like tail measures up to twice as long as the disc; it is thick at the base and tapers significantly to the extremely long, serrated spine placed approximately one-third to halfway along its length. Two spines may be present if a replacement grows in before the original drops off. Posterior to the spine origin, there is a low ventral fin fold that does not reach the spine tip. Young rays are completely smooth-skinned; with age small prickles appear over the center of the back, as well as a row of small thorns along the midline from between the eyes to the origin of the spine. This species is a plain dark purple to bluey-green above, extending onto the tail fold, and a slightly lighter shade below. When captured and handled, it exudes thick black mucus that covers its body. Its all-around dark colouration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat.", "about": "The Pelagic Stingray is a medium-sized ray that is circumglobal throughout the tropical and temperate oceans and is perhaps the only stingray to inhabit open ocean waters. It occurs in the epipelagic zone mostly to depths of 100 m, although it has been recorded to 381m. Pelagic Stingrays may segregate by sex, vertically in that males are found in deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. The Pelagic Stingray is an active predator that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth, for grasping and cutting into slippery prey. It feeds on crustaceans including amphipods, krill, and larval crabs, molluscs including squid, octopus, and pteropods, bony fishes including herring, mackerel, sea horses and filefish, comb jellies and medusae, and polychaete worms. In the Western Indian Ocean, this species is a common bycatch in tuna longline fisheries.", "biology": "Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 2-13 and size at birth of 14-24 cm DW. Males reach sexual maturity at 37-50 cm DW and two years of age, and females at 39-50 cm DW and three years of age. This species may live up to 10-12 years.

Adults inhabit the sandy surf-zone, muddy estuaries and offshore banks to depths of 40 m while juvenile\u2019s habitat is similar to depths of 33 m. The adult\u2019s diet consists primarily of benthic (bottom dwelling) crustaceans while the juveniles\u2019 diet is unknown but is probably similar to the adults. Sharpnose Stingrays are caught as a bycatch by recreational shore anglers and targeted for weight during shore angling competitions, but most are released. They are also landed by shore anglers fishing in estuaries. They comprise a small percentage (8.2%) of the bycatch taken by prawn trawls on the Thukela Banks during summer and are occasionally caught as a bycatch by inshore and estuarine recreational boat anglers and often targeted by competitive light tackle boat anglers but seldom kept. They are sometimes caught in shark nets off certain KZN beaches. Adults and juveniles are caught as a bycatch in beach seine-net fishery off Durban. Although numbers appear to be stable in SA, their vulnerable life history characteristics (e.g. low fecundity, late maturity, inshore distribution, etc.) make them vulnerable to overexploitation in some heavily fished areas.", "biology": "The Sharpnose Stingray\u2019s reproductive style is viviparous with histotrophy. This means that internal fertilization takes place, a placental connection to the mother exists, and where the developing embryo receives additional nutrition from its mother in the form of uterine secretions until the live young are born. The breeding/spawning season occurs in summer and is thought to pup in shallow waters off sandy beaches and bays in KZN and MOZ.

It occurs at depths of 0-480 m. It occurs offshore, on the outer shelf and uppermost slope; sometimes close inshore, in very shallow (0 m) depths. Found on sandy bottoms, in bays, harbors, and near rocky reefs, often in aggregations. It feeds on fish, bivalves, squid, and crustaceans. Frequently raises its tail in a scorpion-like fashion when approached but is considered more inquisitive rather than aggressive. The barbed tail, however, can inflict a severe or potentially fatal wound. Sometimes caught by anglers In South Africa it is taken in the recreational line, beach seine, and gillnet fisheries and suspected to be captured in the demersal shark longline, commercial line, and demersal trawl fisheries. Commercial and recreational fishers regularly amputate stingrays'' tails before releasing them to reduce the risk of injury although this practise is discouraged. The relatively large number of Short-tail Stingrays seen by divers without tails suggests they survive capture and release well.", "biology": "It exhibits aplacental viviparity, with embryos feeding initially on yolk, and then receiving additional nourishment from the mother by indirect absorption of uterine fluid enriched with mucus, fat or protein through specialised structures. They display distinct pairing with embrace. During courtship, the male will hold onto the pectoral margin of a female (sometimes for hours) as she swims through the water. The male flips under the female and inserts a clasper. The male beats his tail from side to side to move the clasper backward and forward in the cloca. Copulation lasts 3-5 minutes. Males have been observed to nudge the female''s abdomen during parturition. It is viviparous, young born at about 36 cm DW. Max length: 430 cm TL; Common length: 125 cm TL.

Larvae and post larvae follow olfactory cues to recruit into estuaries at approximately 6-10 mm SL. This is a common fish in its range, one of the most abundant in some areas. It inhabits estuaries such as the Kowie, the Msikaba, the West Kleinemond, the Kasouga, the Swartkops, and the Kromme. Recruitment into estuaries is not dependant on season or mouth status (open/closed) as they use mouth overwashing events to enter these estuarine nursery habitats. After an estuarine residency period of between 12 and 23 months sub-adults (~140 mm SL) migrate out of estuaries into the marine environment and do not return. Movement of adults in the marine environment is not known as there has been a very low recapture rate recorded in the ORI Tagging Project. A southward summer migration into Cape waters is inferred but has not been substantiated. Adults inhabit primarily marine environments and are common in shallow coastal waters <50 m depth. It is an inshore species found in sandy areas and over shallow reefs. Juveniles are dependent on estuaries as nursery areas where they remain until just prior to reaching sexual maturity and are often found in close association with seagrass beds. Adults feed on echinoderms (starfish, sea urchin, or sea cucumber), crustaceans, molluscs, barnacles, bryozoans (a family of small filter feeding invertebrates that live as colonies) and polychaetes (bristleworms). Juveniles graze on algae and seagrass, such as eelgrass but digest only epiphytic diatoms (organisms that live on the surfaces of plants or other algae) and encrusting organisms. Cape Stumpnose is primarily caught by recreational and subsistence shore and estuarine fishers using light tackle. They are very important in several EC estuaries. Degradation of estuarine nursery areas along the entire south-eastern seaboard may have resulted in an overall reduction in biomass of this species. Protection of suitable marine and estuarine habitats is therefore imperative for the future status of this species.", "biology": "Cape Stumpnose is categorised as an estuarine-dependent species with marine spawning, post-larval recruitment (at ~10 mm fork length [FL]) into estuarine systems, and a return to the marine environment at ~150 mm FL. Reproductive style: Unknown. Breeding/spawning season: May-Aug in KZN; Jul-Feb in the SE Cape. The recorded occurrence of Cape Stumpnose larvae on the KZN south coast throughout the year with peaks in abundance during Apr-May and Aug-Dec may be a strategy to ensure that some larvae can be recruited into estuaries that are not always open to the sea. Breeding/spawning locality: Spawning occurs in the nearshore marine environment, probably in close proximity to estuary mouths. Age at maturity: Unknown. Length at maturity: Combined sexes: 190 mm TL; KZN. Reported length at maturity is 150 mm SL in the EC. Maximum recorded age: Unknown. Maximum recorded weight: The SA shore angling record is 2.4 kg (SASAA 2012), however, the maximum weight of adults seldom exceeds 1 kg.

However, they are likely to consist of a complex of genetically distinct populations. In southern Africa they are more common along southern MOZ, KZN and EC coast, occasionally extending as far south as Wilderness in the WC in summer. They are also common off SE Madagascar. They are considered resident. The ORI Tagging Project shows a mean distance travelled of 10km. Juveniles are resident in estuaries until ~20 cm SL where after they disperse into the marine environment.  Adults appear to be residents within a relatively large home range of 1.1 km (linear distance) in the surf-zone, with some individuals undertaking large-scale movements in excess of 200 km. Adults are primarily marine and are common in shallow coastal waters <50 m depth. It is an inshore species found in sandy areas and over shallow reefs. Adults, >350 mm SL, are seldom recorded in estuaries. Juveniles make extensive use of estuaries (mainly larger estuaries in KZN and further north), which serve as nursery areas, where they grow to maturity. Adults feed primarily on hard-shelled invertebrates including molluscs (bivalves and gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs), echinoderms (sand dollars and urchins) and crustaceans (crabs, mole crabs and barnacles). Juveniles within estuaries feed primarily on algae, aquatic macrophytes (aquatic plant large enough to be seen by the naked eye), amphipods (crustaceans with no carapace), small crabs and bivalves. Natal Stumpnose are an important recreational angling fish in SA waters, sought after by recreational shore anglers, estuarine anglers and spearfishermen. They are also caught by subsistence and artisanal fishers in St Lucia and Kosi Bay using fish traps and gill-nets and are also commercially exploited in trawl and gillnets elsewhere in the world.

Tagging in the De Hoop and Struisbaai area has shown Red Stumpnose to be extremely resident. Trends in commercial catches from Struisbaai reflect a seasonal increase in catches during winter (May-Jul) and early summer (Oct-Nov) suggesting some measure of aggregation. Prior to the decline in stocks, spearfishermen operating in False Bay in the 1960s to early 1970s used to target Red Stumpnose on deep, flat reefs (15 -20 m) along the western coast of False Bay during Mar-Aug. The average weight of the fish was between 2.5 to 3 kg. Adults inhabit offshore reefs to 150 m while juveniles are found on shallower reefs. The adult diet is dominated by ophiuroids (brittlestars), gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs) and polychaete worms, but also feed on sea urchins, octopus and crabs. Juvenile Red Stumpnose <300 mm FL feed more on soft bodied organisms such as malacostraca (crustaceans with compound eyes which are typically on stalks includes crabs, shrimps, lobsters). As the size of individuals increases their diet shifts to contain a higher proportion of hard prey such as gastropods (snails). Red Stumpnose are a seasonal component of the commercial linefishery, especially on the Agulhas Banks. They are also taken by the recreational ski-boat fishery and spearfishery. Incidental catches are taken by inshore trawlers operating in the MosselBay to Cape Infanta area. Evidence suggests that this species is heavily overexploited. It is already commercially extinct in places like False Bay, and now only forms a very small component of total linefish catches, highlighting its low level of abundance. There is also no effective management plan in place to improve the stock status of this iconic species. On-going catch and effort monitoring is essential.", "biology": "For a mediumsized seabream, it is particularly long-lived and slow growing.

Four discrete areas of White Stumpnose abundance exist including W Cape (Saldanha), SW Cape, S Cape and SE Cape. They are also known from Luderitz in NAM. Movements have been studied in Saldanha Bay. Fish migrate across the bay, spending Jun-Aug in Saldanha Bay, and the remainder in Langebaan Lagoon. While in the lagoon, they display a degree of site fidelity but undertake diel (daily vertical) commuting behaviour. On the Cape south coast the fish migrate to deeper water offshore in winter. Adults inhabit shallow reefs along the South and East Cape coasts, down to 50 m in depth in summer. They are found in large shoals over sandy seabeds, near small reefs and rocky outcrops and unconsolidated sediments down to 120 m depth on the Agulhas Bank in winter. An isolated population in Langebaan Lagoon (Saldanha Bay) frequents tidal channels with sandy bottoms in <10 m depth. Juveniles are found on seagrass beds, coastal lagoons and estuaries. Crustaceans and molluscs dominate the diet of adults. Larger fish are capable of crushing clams, mussels and gastropods (snails, whelks and slugs) >20 mm. Juveniles feed on small crustaceans found in the water column of the surf zone including amphipods (beach fleas, sand hoppers, etc), isopods (small aquatic crustaceans with seven pairs of legs adapted for crawling), ostracods (tiny marine crustaceans with a shrimp-like body enclosed in a bivalve shell) and filamentous algae. White Stumpnose are caught by the inshore trawlers between Algoa Bay and Port Alfred, and off Mossel Bay. Linefishermen (recreational and commercial) catch them on the south coast and in False Bay, but much larger quantities are caught on the west coast in Saldanha Bay. They used to be netted by beach seines in large quantities in Hout Bay, Blouberg and Melkbos, but these stocks have collapsed. Estuarine anglers catch juvenile fish in estuaries from the Berg River in the west to the Kowie River in the east. Occasionally caught as bycatch of gillnet fisheries on the West coast. No reliable assessments have been made for any of the stocks of White Stumpnose, although there is good evidence that the stocks on the S Cape coast and on the west of Cape Peninsula and Table Bay have collapsed.

In southern Africa they are most commonly found offshore but are sometimes seen in coastal waters, generally above the thermocline. They are migrants. Sexually mature fish move into tropical waters during winter for spawning and back into temperate or cold waters for feeding in summer. They have developed unique characteristics, such as special eye muscles and a heat exchange system that allows them to swim in deep, cold water in search of prey. Adult Swordfish can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (5-27\u00b0C), the widest temperature tolerance of any billfish, but is often found in surface waters at temperatures over 13\u00b0C. Swordfish are one of the fastest predators in the ocean. Their streamlined body allows them to swim at high speeds, up to 57 km/h, and they can dive to depths of up to 1 000 m. Juvenile Swordfish are commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters and migrate to higher latitudes as they mature. Swordfish feed on a wide variety of prey including groundfish, pelagic fish, deep-water fish and invertebrates, cephalopods (octopus and squid) being the preferred prey. They are believed to feed throughout the water column. They capture prey by slashing their bill back and forth, stunning or injuring prey in the process. The diet of Swordfish is known to vary considerably, both geographically and seasonally. Juveniles will also feed opportunistically on fish and invertebrates. Larvae over 10 mm feed almost exclusively on the larvae of other fish species.

It is tolerant of wide ranges in salinity and oxygen concentrations. Some populations may complete life cycle in freshwater. The swim bladder, attached to the esophagus, can be filled directly with air and permits the fish to live in oxygen-poor waters. The diet of the Atlantic tarpon changes as the fish grows with those in the leptocephalus stage absorbing nutrients directly from the water, those in the juvenile stage eating zooplankton and other small prey, and adults primarily consuming fish, crabs, and shrimp.

Their movement patterns are unknown. Only 69 have been tagged in the ORI Tagging Project and none have been recaptured. Juveniles appear to remain in estuaries (or connected freshwater bodies) until they reach maturity. Adults presumably migrate out to sea to spawn and may re-enter estuaries once spawning is complete. They have been classified as a facultative catadromous (behaving in response to circumstances rather than by nature, born in marine habitats, but migrate to freshwater areas where they spend the majority of their lives growing and maturing. It can tolerate oxygen-poor water by `breathing'' air into a lung-like air bladder. As adults they return to the sea to spawn) species implying flexibility in movement behaviour and habitat usage. Adults are a solitary species found in shallow coastal waters, but favours estuaries and mangrove swamps, completely tolerant of freshwater, often recorded from freshwater pans and rivers on the KZN north coast and MOZ, nowhere abundant. Juveniles appear to be attracted to brackish or freshwater lakes and pans, which they enter from adjacent estuaries during high rainfall periods. Their larvae have been classified as estuarine dependent. In Papua New Guinea, individuals have been recorded returning to the sea before reaching maturity. Adults are daytime voracious feeders, consuming small pelagic fish, fry of larger species and shrimps, crustaceans and terrestrial insects. The juvenile\u2019s diet is unknown. Although relatively seldom caught, they are sought after for its fighting qualities and are targeted by anglers using light spinning or fly tackle. They are occasionally caught in the illegal gill-net fishery in St Lucia and in the beach-seine fishery in Durban but are considered to be of poor eating quality.

In SA this species shoals offshore and seldom approaches the coast. They are migrants. Through tag-recapture studies it has been shown that bigeye do undertake migrations, but this is dependent on the age group and may be in response to feeding and/or reproduction. Adults (>100 cm FL) are epi- and mesopelagic in open waters. Factors affecting the distribution include the depth of the deep scattering layer (''false bottom''), the temperature and the oxygen concentration.  Bigeye expose themselves to large temperature changes of up to 20\u00b0C, from 25\u00b0C at the surface layer to temperatures of ~5\u00b0C at 500 m depth. Clear activity patterns in vertical movements were shown with archival tagging, from 0-100 m during the day and 400-500 m at night. Bigeye can withstand a lower dissolved oxygen concentration than any other tuna species. Juveniles (30-70 cm FL) occupy surface waters and are commonly found in schools at FADs. Off SA Bigeye Tuna, together with Yellowfin Tuna, are mainly targeted by foreign-flagged long-line pelagic vessels although they are caught by the entire pelagic longline fleet.

It is a highly migratory species and an opportunistic feeder, preying on a wide variety of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, salps, and other marine animals. Southern Bluefin Tuna, like other pelagic tuna species, are part of a group of bony fishes that can maintain their body core temperature up to 10\u00b0C above the ambient temperature. This advantage enables them to maintain high metabolic output for predation and migrating large distances. Southern Bluefin Tuna is an important commercial species. The main market is Japan, where a high percentage of the world''s catches are consumed as sashimi (Polacheck 2012, Collette and Graves 2019).

Longfin Tuna can swim at speeds exceeding 80 kmh and cover vast areas during annual migrations. They have a highly evolved circulatory system that regulates their body temperature and increases muscle efficiency; a high metabolism; and high blood pressure, volume, and hemoglobin, all of which increase oxygen absorption. They lack the structures needed to pump oxygen-rich water over their gills so; in order to breathe, they must constantly swim with their mouths open. Populations are found in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Indian and Pacific Oceans. The species prefers cooler and deeper water in the temperature e range 10-20\u00b0C. In SA waters schools of South Atlantic Longfin Tuna occur in larger quantities along the temperate west coast compared to schools of Indian Ocean Longfin Tuna which occur along the warmer southeast coast. There is little information available on Longfin Tuna migrations in SA waters. There are no recorded migrations of Longfin Tuna from the north to the south Atlantic. There are records of transatlantic migrations and migrations from the North Atlantic into the Mediterranean; however, migration routes in the South Atlantic and the SW Indian Ocean remain uncertain. Adult Longfin Tuna are a temperate tuna spawning in tropical waters. Its habitat is the northern and southern gyres of the oceans (only southern gyre in the Indian Ocean). Longfin Tuna migrate widely from their spawning grounds to the poleward limits of the gyres where water temperatures are below 15\u00b0C. Juvenile tuna from 2 to 35 cm FL are not caught and this life stage remains virtually unknown. From around 40 cm FL Longfin Tuna start appearing in surface fisheries. The underdeveloped swim bladder in juveniles gives them limited vertical movement in the water column. Juveniles concentrate in temperate areas, often in association with fronts with temperatures ranges from 15-20\u00b0C. Pre-adults (2-5 year old) appear to be more migratory than adults. They eat an enormous amount of food to fuel their high metabolism, sometimes consuming as much as 25 percent of their own weight every day. Larger species of billfish, tuna, and sharks eat Longfin Tuna. The tuna pole and commercial linefishery contribute the most towards Longfin Tuna catches, with 4 100 mt reported in 2010. The pelagic longline and recreational linefishery catch Longfin Tuna in smaller quantities, about 10% of the SA catches.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Gonochorist (separate sexes).

Breeding/spawning season: Spawning season for the South Atlantic stock is spring-summer from Sep-Mar and Oct-Mar for the Indian Ocean stock. Females broadcast their eggs near the surface, where they\u2019re fertilized. Depending on their size, females release between 800,000 and 2.6 million eggs every time they spawn. Breeding/spawning locality: Spawning areas in the south Atlantic are off the eastern Brazilian coast, from 5\u00b0S to 20\u00b0S.

They occur all around the SA coast but are most common from Algoa Bay to Maputo. They are migrants. Tag recoveries provide evidence of rapid, large-scale movements of Skipjack Tuna in the Indian Ocean. Their movements are influenced by environmental conditions and by their tendency to group around floating objects. Adults generally form large schools, often in association with other tunas of similar size such as juveniles of Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna. Skipjack is the predominant species under fish aggregation devices (FADs). They normally inhabit waters where the surface temperature is between 20-30\u00b0C, corresponding to the mixed layer of tropical oceans which can extend to ~200 m in depth depending on area. Skipjack are also associated with convergences, boundaries between cold and warm water masses, outcrops and other hydrographic discontinuities. Juvenile\u2019s habitat is similar to the adults, occupying surface waters and influenced by environmental conditions. Adult skipjacks are opportunistic predators, and their diet varies in time and space. The predominant items in their diet are fish; snipefish, mackerels, silvery lightfish, anchovy, cephalopods (octopus and squid) and crustaceans. Cannibalism occurs occasionally.

The geographical limits are 45\u00b0-50\u00b0N and S. The Yellowfin Tuna that occurs in SA waters may be from the Atlantic and/or Indian Ocean stock. They are migrants. Annual movement occurs in the Eastern Atlantic of mature fish to the spawning area off West Africa. Off southern Africa, progressively larger fish are found with increasing latitude. Three Yellowfin Tuna tagged off Tanzania were recovered in SA waters, two of them off Cape Point. Adults are generally distributed in the first 350 m of the ocean. However, archival tagging has shown that this species is capable of very deep dives (over 1, 000 m), probably to feed on mesopelagic prey. The preferred habitat is at temperatures above 22C. Juveniles spend more than 90% of their time in depths less than 100 m which correspond to the mixed layer. Juveniles form schools around fish aggregating devices (FADs), either anchored FADs in coastal areas or drifting FADs in the high seas. Adults are opportunistic top predators with a broad prey spectrum. Prey items include a large diversity of epipelagic fish, mesopelagic fish, crustaceans, crab larvae and cephalopods (octopus and squid). Juvenile Yellowfin Tuna are opportunistic feeders on surface dwelling prey (epipelagic teleosts, squids, crustaceans). In the East Atlantic, they also feed on a small mesopelagic fish (oceanic lightfish) when it shoals in the mixed layer. Pelagic longline fisheries target large (adult) yellowfin. Juveniles are caught in surface waters by the tuna pole sector primarily along the Cape west coast. Juveniles are also caught in purse seine fisheries in tropical oceans. Yellowfin Tuna are an important gamefish targeted by the recreational skiboat fishery along the eastern and southwestern seaboards of SA.", "biology": "Reproductive style: Gonochorist (separate sexes). An intermediate pattern of reproduction implies asynchronous oocyte development (capable of ovulating on a regular basis, sometimes every day, over a prolonged period). They produce an average of 1 million to 4 million eggs each time they spawn. One female can lay between 5 and 60 million eggs per year. Breeding/spawning season: Oct-Mar in the Eastern Atlantic. Dec-Mar in the West Indian Ocean with main spawning grounds located west of 75\u00b0E. Breeding/spawning locality: In the Eastern Atlantic the equatorial area from the coasts of the Gabon (Gulf of Guinea) to 25\u00b0W is the main spawning area.
